The project includes the web-based HCV guidance platform (www. hcvguidelines.org) to enable rapid, accessible dissemination of new and/or updated information and recommendations in response to the latest data from the field. The HCV guidance website (hereafter, the HCV guidance) has been highly successful. From the launch of the HCV guidance in January 2014 through April 2022, the site has been accessed by more than 2 million unique users generating more than 4 million page views. In 2021, the site had more the 194 000 unique users from 201 countries and territories, with most visits originating from the United States, India, Russia, Canada, and Pakistan. Under the umbrella of the HCV guidance, the AASLD-IDSA HCV Guidance Panel (hereafter, the Guidance Panel) also issues regular, periodic published updates to review new or updated data and recommendations and an overview of the ever-changing landscape of the HCV epidemic. Recognizing that viral hepatitis poses a public health threat on par with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis, in June 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first global health sector strategy and set forth the goal of elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030. Specific HCV elimination targets include a 90% reduction in incidence and prevalence, treatment of 80% of eligible persons with chronic infection, a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths, and universal access to key prevention and treatment services. In response to the WHO\u2019s call to action, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine developed a US strategic plan for viral hepatitis elimination. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)  subsequently developed national implementation strategies and targets commensurate with those set forth by the WHO. Notably, the new and updated recommendations highlighted and discussed in this update both independently and collectively support, promote, and advance accomplishment of HCV elimination. Major changes in the HCV guidance since the previous 2020 publication featured in this update include an ongoing emphasis on universal HCV screening; new recommendations that address the management of incomplete treatment adherence; updated recommendations regarding simplified treatment with minimal monitoring and expanded eligibility; management and treatment recommendations for solid organ transplant recipients; newly expanded treatment and retreatment recommendations for children and adolescents; and screening, management, and treatment recommendations for unique and key populations. In addition, we highlight key issues critical to HCV management with the mission of HCV elimination in mind. See Figure 1 for key points in this HCV guidance update. \nFigure 1: Keypoints in HCV guidance summary:\n\u2022\tUniversal HCV screening is recommended.\n\u2022\tThe simplified HCV treatment algorithm now includes persons living with HIV.\n\u2022\tA new algorithm for incomplete treatment adherence is included with a key recommendation for persons who have missed \u2265 7 days of DAA therapy.\n\u2022\tHCV treatment is recommended for infected persons residing in jail or prison.\n\u2022\tEmerging data highlight the safety and efficacy of HCV DAA treatment in persons who have undergone solid organ transplantation. \nThe HCV guidance was developed and is regularly updated by a volunteer panel of more than 30 infectious diseases and hepatology clinicians and investigators with HCV expertise representing IDSA and AASLD, respectively. Four co-chairs (2 from each society) oversee the work of the Guidance Panel. The HCV guidance undergoes major biannual updates based on a rigorous literature review that encompasses peer-reviewed, published literature and relevant abstracts from national and international scientific conferences. The data are re-viewed by section leads, with points of discussion resolved during section and full panel remote meetings. New or updated recommendations are evaluated using a modified scale adapted from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association practice guidelines. All new and updated recommendations are reviewed and approved by the IDSA and AASLD governing boards prior to online release or print publication."}]}

The USPSTF subsequently recommended universal HCV screening for adults aged 18 to 79 years in March 2020. In April 2020, the CDC recommended HCV screening at least once in all adults aged \u226518 years and for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, except in settings where HCV prevalence is <0.1%. The rationale for universal HCV screening includes costeffectiveness; improved HCV case finding; shifting epidemiology of HCV infection with incident infections occurring primarily in young adults; and the availability of safe, cost-effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Universal screening is a crucial and necessary component of any HCV elimination strategy because it is the entry point into the HCV continuum of care. For initial HCV testing, the Guidance Panel recommends HCV antibody screening with reflex HCV RNA testing to establish the presence of active infection (as opposed to spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance). Recommendations without rigorous implementation, how- ever, are ineffectual. HCV screening, diagnosis, and treatment were significantly adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of HCV anti- body and HCV RNA tests processed by a large US, multicenter, commercial clinical laboratory decreased precipitously beginning in mid-March 2020, coincident with the US federal government declaring a national state of emergency due to COVID-19. HCV RNA\u2013positive test results decreased 62% in March 2020 and remained 39% below baseline in July 2020, with a concomitant decline in the number of DAA prescriptions dispensed. Investigators who conducted a similar study in Ontario, Canada, reported comparable decreases in HCV antibody screening and confirmative HCV RNA testing during each of the first 3 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduced level of HCV testing negatively affecting initiation of HCV treatment appears corroborated by findings from a US national, retrospective study wherein only 23% of people on Medicaid with a positive HCV RNA test between 30 January 2019 and 31 October 2020 initiated DAA treatment within 360 days of diagnosis. A survey conducted among European Association for the Study of the Liver members representing 48 clinical centers also demonstrated decreased HCV testing, diagnosis, and treatment in 2020 compared with 2019 (prepandemic). Collectively, these findings underscore the critical importance of ongoing, rigorous, universal HCV screening for case identification and linkage to care. In addition, monitoring the proportion of persons who meet steps in the HCV cascade of care will be critical to assessing the quality of HCV care."}]}

Recognizing that incomplete DAA treatment may occur in clinical practice and potentially contribute to treatment failure, the HCV guidance includes a new algorithm for the management of incomplete adherence as part of DAA treatment monitoring (Figure 2). The algorithm applies only to DAA treatment\u2013naive persons and, generally, the same patient populations who are eligible for the simplified treatment algorithms described in the following section. Excluded persons with incomplete adherence should be managed in consultation with a specialist in HCV management. Although few studies have examined incomplete medication adherence in the DAA era, data suggest that it is relatively common, occurring in 11% to 40% of persons on treatment. Most episodes of nonadherence appear short-lived. One study demonstrated that 61% of nonadherent episodes lasted 1 to 2 days. These short periods of nonadherence were not associated with virologic failure. Sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12) was 94% among both adherent and nonadherent participants, where nonadherence was defined as taking <90% of the total prescribed dosage. Longer periods of nonadherence, however, may adversely affect SVR. Investigators who examined the relationship between premature discontinuation of DAA therapy and SVR found that among study participants with F0 to F3 liver disease, SVR12 was 50% in persons who received <4 weeks of DAA treatment compared with 99% SVR12 in those who received \u22654 weeks of treatment. Among participants with compensated cirrhosis, SVR12 rates were 83% and 95% in those who completed <8 weeks of DAA therapy compared with \u22658 weeks of treatment, respectively. Based on these limited findings and the expert consensus of the Guidance Panel, a management algorithm that considers the timing and duration of the nonadherence, as well as specific patient factors (ie, genotype 3 infection and presence of compensated cirrhosis), is recommended (see Figure 2). Additional large-scale studies in clinical practice settings that examine the relationship between DAA adherence and SVR12, including the threshold level of adherence below which SVR12 is adversely affected, are sorely needed.\nFigure 2: Recommended management of DAA treatment interruptions for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis receiving glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

A key aspect of facilitating the implementation of this recommendation/goal is expanding the pool of clinicians who provide HCV treatment, thereby boosting accessibility and delivery of care. Accordingly and coincident with the accumulation of real-world data and experience with the pangenotypic DAA regimens, the HCV guidance first introduced the simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive persons (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis) in 2019 . The current update to the simplified treatment algorithms features reduced pretreatment and on-treatment clinician intervention and expanded eligibility of persons who can be treated using these approaches. Recent data from a global sample of persons undergoing DAA treatment for chronic HCV infection suggest that a minimal on-treatment monitoring approach is safe and effective and leads to an SVR rate that is comparable to that realized with standard monitoring [33]. The minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach was examined in an international, phase 4, open-label, single-arm trial. Four hundred treatment-naive participants aged \u226518 years with active HCV infection were enrolled from 38 sites in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States. Participants included persons with compensated cirrhosis and HIV coinfection. Key exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breastfeeding, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive; due to possible risk of HBV reactivation). However, participants with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] positive, with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies [anti-HBs]) were eligible. Of the 400 enrolled participants, 399 initiated a planned 12-week course of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg). At entry, 42% (166) were living with HIV, 9% (34) had compensated cirrhosis, and 32% (121 of 374) with an avail- able HBV panel had resolved HBV infection. The 4 components of minimal monitoring included no pretreatment genotyping, dispensing the entire treatment course at entry, no scheduled on- treatment visits or laboratory monitoring, and remote contact at week 4 to assess DAA adherence and at week 22 to schedule SVR assessment at week 24. SVR was achieved by 95% (379 of 399) of those who initiated treatment. Fourteen participants experienced a serious adverse event between treatment initiation and week 28; none were treatment-related or led to treatment discontinuation or death. Given the findings of this minimal monitoring study, treatment-naive persons with HIV/HCV coinfection are newly eligible for a simplified HCV treatment approach. Figure 3 shows the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the simplified HCV treatment approaches. Figure 4 provides an overview of the simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis. Figure 5 reviews the simplified treatment algorithm for HCV treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis. The inclusion of persons living with HIV in the simplified HCV treatment algorithm is consistent with the DHHS Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV. In this guidance, the decision to expand eligibility to include persons living with HIV was informed by the comparable SVR12 rates in those with and without HIV coinfection in the MINMON study, the availability of integrase strand transfer inhibitor\u2013based antiretroviral regimens that mitigate concerns of drug\u2013drug interactions between HIV and HCV medications, and the need to expand treatment access, particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic era.\n\nFigure 3: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for simplified HCV treatment algorithm:\n\u2022\tWho is eligible for a simplified HCV treatment algorithm?

A key aspect of facilitating the implementation of this recommendation/goal is expanding the pool of clinicians who provide HCV treatment, thereby boosting accessibility and delivery of care. Accordingly and coincident with the accumulation of real-world data and experience with the pangenotypic DAA regimens, the HCV guidance first introduced the simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive persons (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis) in 2019 . The current update to the simplified treatment algorithms features reduced pretreatment and on-treatment clinician intervention and expanded eligibility of persons who can be treated using these approaches. Recent data from a global sample of persons undergoing DAA treatment for chronic HCV infection suggest that a minimal on-treatment monitoring approach is safe and effective and leads to an SVR rate that is comparable to that realized with standard monitoring [33]. The minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach was examined in an international, phase 4, open-label, single-arm trial. Four hundred treatment-naive participants aged \u226518 years with active HCV infection were enrolled from 38 sites in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States. Participants included persons with compensated cirrhosis and HIV coinfection. Key exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breastfeeding, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive; due to possible risk of HBV reactivation). However, participants with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] positive, with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies [anti-HBs]) were eligible. Of the 400 enrolled participants, 399 initiated a planned 12-week course of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg). At entry, 42% (166) were living with HIV, 9% (34) had compensated cirrhosis, and 32% (121 of 374) with an avail- able HBV panel had resolved HBV infection. The 4 components of minimal monitoring included no pretreatment genotyping, dispensing the entire treatment course at entry, no scheduled on- treatment visits or laboratory monitoring, and remote contact at week 4 to assess DAA adherence and at week 22 to schedule SVR assessment at week 24. SVR was achieved by 95% (379 of 399) of those who initiated treatment. Fourteen participants experienced a serious adverse event between treatment initiation and week 28; none were treatment-related or led to treatment discontinuation or death. Given the findings of this minimal monitoring study, treatment-naive persons with HIV/HCV coinfection are newly eligible for a simplified HCV treatment approach. Figure 3 shows the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the simplified HCV treatment approaches. Figure 4 provides an overview of the simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis. Figure 5 reviews the simplified treatment algorithm for HCV treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis. The inclusion of persons living with HIV in the simplified HCV treatment algorithm is consistent with the DHHS Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV. In this guidance, the decision to expand eligibility to include persons living with HIV was informed by the comparable SVR12 rates in those with and without HIV coinfection in the MINMON study, the availability of integrase strand transfer inhibitor\u2013based antiretroviral regimens that mitigate concerns of drug\u2013drug interactions between HIV and HCV medications, and the need to expand treatment access, particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic era.\n\nFigure 3: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for simplified HCV treatment algorithm:\n\u2022\tWho is eligible for a simplified HCV treatment algorithm?

Widespread use of recommended initial treatment regimens has the potential to substantially reduce hepatitis C prevalence. Given the many benefits of virologic cure, including reduced risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and all-cause mortality, expanded use of DAA treatment and the associated probable cure has the capacity to reduce HCV-related disease burden at individual, national, and potentially global levels. Since the last published update, genotypic activity has been added to the hierarchical ranking of treatment regimens (in addition to recommended or alternative, evidence level, and alphabetical order). Table 1 presents a summary of initial treatment recommendations for treatment-naive adults. Shortening the duration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy to 8 weeks for persons with compensated cirrhosis is a notable change. The updated recommendation is supported by the findings from the international, single-arm, open-label, phase 3b EXPEDITION-8 trial, titled \u201cGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks in treatment-na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotypes 1-6 and compensated cirrhosis\u201d. Investigators enrolled 343 treatment-naive participants aged \u226518 years with chronic HCV infection (genotypes 1 through 6) and compensated cirrhosis. Key exclusion criteria included coinfection with HIV and/or HBV or a history of hepatic decompensation. Participants received an 8-week  course  of  once-daily glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg). SVR12 was 98% (335 of 343) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Seven participants experienced a serious adverse event, only 1 of which was treatment-related. One participant who had low baseline leukocyte and neutrophil counts experienced grade 3 leukopenia and neutropenia that presented on posttreatment day 29, which the investigator considered treatment-related. No adverse event led to treatment discontinuation or death.\n\nAnother significant change is the recommendation that sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir may be used as an alternative regimen for persons with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis. This new recommendation is based on findings from the international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 POLARIS-3 clinical trial, titled \u201cEfficacy of 8 weeks of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir in patients with chronic HCV infection: 2 phase 3 randomized trials\u201d and acknowledges limited access to resistance-associated substitution (RAS) testing in some settings. Investigators enrolled 220 DAA treatment\u2013naive participants with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis who were randomized to 8 weeks of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/ velpatasvir (100 mg)/voxilaprevir (100 mg) or 12 weeks of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg). SVR12 was 96% in both treatment arms. Initial treatment using elbasvir/grazoprevir for genotype 1a infection was changed from a recommended to an alternative regimen because of the need for baseline RAS testing. Additionally, several regimens are no longer recommended because the therapeutics are either no longer available in the United States and/or the regimens have inferior SVR rates compared with currently recommended DAA regimens.

Among patients with a prior sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment failure, 16 weeks of glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir plus sofosbuvir and weight-based ribavirin is recommended based on the improved resistance profile of pibrentasvir and high response rate seen with this duration of therapy among genotype 3\u2013infected participants in the MAGELLAN-3 trial. Extension to 24 weeks or longer with this regimen should be considered for persons with factors that may reduce the likelihood of achieving SVR (eg, genotype 3 infection with cirrhosis or prior treatment failure with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir plus sofosbuvir). While there are case report data that use this treatment duration, no clinical trial data are available to support such an approach.

Given that available data support the safety and efficacy of DAA therapy in the posttransplant setting, many transplant centers have begun using solid organs from HCV-positive donors for HCV-negative recipients to increase the pool of available organs. The pool of HCV-positive donors includes both HCV-viremic donors (ie, HCV RNA\u2013positive) and HCV-seropositive donors (ie, HCV antibody\u2013positive, HCV RNA\u2013negative [nonviremic]). The use of HCV-positive organs has been shown to be an effective strategy for increasing access to transplantation and reducing wait-list time and overall mortality.\nTiming and Treatment of HCV-Viremic Liver Grafts in Nonviremic Recipients. Emerging data support HCV treatment as early as possible when transplanting an HCV-viremic liver graft into an HCV-seronegative recipient. In a recent multicenter prospective study, 34 HCV-seronegative liver transplant patients underwent transplantation using organs from HCV-positive donors (20 viremic, 14 nonviremic). All recipients of grafts from HCV-viremic donors became viremic by day 3 posttransplantation. DAA treatment was initiated in these graft recipients a median of 27.5 days after transplantation. SVR12 was 100% (20 of 20). One patient developed acute HCV-related membranous nephropathy on postoperative day 18 (prior to initiation of DAA therapy), ultimately resulting in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis despite achieving SVR12. This case highlights the importance of early initiation of DAA therapy posttransplantation to avoid HCV-related complications. The Guidance Panel recommends initiating therapy at least within 2 weeks after transplantation but preferably within 1 week when the patient is clinically stable. An abbreviated duration of DAA therapy is currently not recommended for recipients of organs from HCV-viremic donors due to lack of data demonstrating efficacy. The large reservoir of HCV in a transplanted liver graft may be responsible for the lack of efficacy.\n\nTiming and Treatment of HCV-Viremic Non-Liver Grafts in Nonviremic Recipients. HCV treatment should occur as early as possible in HCV-seronegative patients who undergo transplantation with a non-liver graft from an HCV-viremic donor. This strategy reduces the likelihood of hepatic and extrahepatic HCV-related complications in the immediate posttransplant period. The phase 4, open-label, multicenter MYTHIC clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of 8 weeks of once-daily glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) in 30 HCV-negative kidney transplant recipients who underwent transplantation using a graft from an HCV-viremic donor. Treatment initiation occurred 2 days to 5 days posttransplantation (target was 3 days). All 30 participants achieved SVR12; no HCV-related serious adverse events were reported. Based on this study and others showing benefit(s) associated with early HCV treatment, use of a prophylactic (immediately prior to transplantation or day 0 posttransplantation) or preemptive (day 0 to day 7 posttransplantation; as soon as the patient is clinically stable) strategy for initiation of DAA treatment is recommended for HCV-negative recipients of a non-liver solid organ graft from an HCV-viremic donor. Note that neither approach requires demonstration of HCV viremia in the transplant recipient. Shorter durations of DAA-based therapy in this setting are currently under investigation with promising results. These practices, however, are currently not recommended outside of a clinical trial.\n\n\nOutcomes and Process in Transplantation Using HCV-Viremic Donor Grafts in HCV-Seronegative Recipients.  Data evaluating longer-term patient outcomes after transplantation with an HCV-viremic donor organ have shown encouraging results. Among 51 dual heart/kidney transplant recipients undergoing transplantation with organs from HCV-viremic donors, 1-year survival was comparable to survival in those who received organs from nonviremic donors. Another study that evaluated outcomes among multiorgan transplant recipients (heart/ kidney, heart/lung, heart/liver) demonstrated similar 1-year survival among recipients of organs from HCV-viremic donors compared with those who received organs from HCV-negative donors. In an analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database, HCV-negative liver transplant patients who received the graft from an HCV-positive donor (viremic and nonviremic) were shown to have superior 1-year graft survival rates compared with those who received a graft from an HCV-negative do- nor. Notably, HCV-positive donors were statistically significantly younger than their HCV-negative counterparts. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that donor age, but not do- nor HCV status, was an independent predictor of 1-year graft survival. Extensive informed consent, as recommended by the American Society of Transplantation Consensus Panel, and shared decision-making between the patient and clinical team should occur prior to transplantation of an HCV-viremic organ into an HCV-negative recipient. Patients should understand the risk of HCV infection, risk to caregivers from needlestick exposures, as well as success rates and risks of DAA-based therapy. Given the breadth of safety and efficacy data now available, institutional review board\u2013approved protocols are no longer re- quired. However, based on the unique factors noted, transplant centers should have a specific HCV consent and follow-up process in place."}]}

The HCV seroprevalence among PWID ranges from 18% to 88%, depending on geographic location and duration of IDU exposure. IDU accounts for approximately 70% of new HCV infections. Thus, the growing opioid epidemic has become an important force in the perpetuation of the HCV epidemic. Consequently, achieving the goal of HCV elimination depends heavily on diagnosing and treating HCV infection in PWID and on implementing harm reduction strategies to prevent future infections. Data from Australia support the efficacy of the treatment-as-prevention approach among PWID. After implementation of unrestricted access to DAA therapy in 2016, the proportion of PWID diagnosed with active HCV infection who were treated increased from 3% to 47%, while the proportion of those with HCV viremia declined from 44% to 17%.\nAnnual HCV testing is recommended for PWID with ongoing IDU regardless of either no prior testing or past negative testing. Substance use disorder treatment programs and needle/syringe exchange programs should offer routine, opt-out HCV antibody testing with confirmatory HCV RNA testing and linkage to care for those determined to be HCV-infected PWID with HCV infection should be counseled about measures to reduce the risk of transmission to others and offered linkage to harm reduction services, including intranasal naloxone, needle/syringe service programs, medications for opioid use disorder, and other substance use disorder treatment programs. Clinical trials and observational studies of PWID reporting current IDU at the start of HCV treatment and/or continued use during therapy demonstrate SVR12 rates approaching 95%.

Users may ask about general direct antiviral agents (DAAs) or specify particular drugs from the following list:\n\u2022 Sofosbuvir (Brand name: Sovaldi)\n\u2022 Ledipasvir\\/Sofosbuvir (Brand name: Harvoni)\n\u2022 Daclatasvir (Brand name: Daklinza)\n\u2022 Simeprevir (Brand name: Olysio)\n\u2022 Velpatasvir\\/Sofosbuvir (Brand name: Epclusa)\n\u2022 Elbasvir\\/Grazoprevir (Brand name: Zepatier)\n\u2022 Glecaprevir\\/Pibrentasvir (Brand name: Mavyret)\n\u2022 Paritaprevir\\/Ritonavir\\/Ombitasvir\\/Dasabuvir (Brand name: Viekira Pak)\n\u2022 Voxilaprevir\\/Velpatasvir\\/Sofosbuvir (Brand name: Vosevi)\n\u2022 And others as detailed in my document.\nAbbreviations in the text include:\n\u2022 SOF: Sofosbuvir\n\u2022 SOF\\/VEL: Sofosbuvir\\/Velpatasvir\n\u2022 SOF\\/VEL\\/VOX: Sofosbuvir\\/Velpatasvir\\/Voxilaprevir\n\u2022 GLE\\/PIB: Glecaprevir\\/Pibrentasvir\n\u2022 GZR\\/EBR: Grazoprevir\\/Elbasvir\nFor liver cirrhosis determinations, if not explicitly reported, I will use the following cutoffs:\n\u2022 Elastography: \u2265 13 kPa or \u2265 2.19 m\\/s\n\u2022 APRI: \u2265 3.25\n\u2022 FIB-4: \u2265 2\nRegarding genotype-based treatment, I will always report all possible treatments as per the guidelines, noting treatment experience or naivety, and include ribavirin when mentioned in the document. For any inquiries about DAA treatment strategies and durations, I will verify information accuracy through repeated checks.\nMy documents contain extensive details on drug-drug interactions, categorized broadly (e.g., anticonvulsants) and specifically (e.g., carbamazepine), listed as:\n1. No interaction (e.g., clopidogrel and sofosbuvir),\n2. Potential interaction requiring dose adjustment (e.g., cyclosporine and glecaprevir\\/pibrentasvir),\n3. Contraindications (e.g., amiodarone and sofosbuvir).\nWhen asked about drug interactions with any DAAs, I will initially consult the information on the class of medications, then specific drugs, providing the most accurate and relevant responses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Management of Unique and Key Populations Persons in Correctional Settings"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recent cross-sectional surveys suggest that the HCV seroprevalence among incarcerated populations in the United States ranges from 3.0% to 34.6%, which exceeds the 1.7% HCV seroprevalence in the general population. More than 90% of these persons are eventually released and reenter the general population where they can contribute to HCV spread in the community and may have little contact with the healthcare system. Given the high HCV prevalence among persons in the US correctional system, the success of the US HCV elimination effort depends on identifying infected individuals in jails and prisons, linking these persons to medical care for HCV management, and providing access to antiviral treatment. Jails and prisons should therefore implement opt-out HCV testing that consists of HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory HCV RNA testing if antibody-positive. Universal opt-out testing of incarcerated persons for chronic HCV is highly cost-effective and has been shown to reduce ongoing HCV transmission and the incidence of advanced liver disease. DAA treatment for chronic HCV infection is feasible within jail and prison settings and would aid the HCV elimination effort. Chronically infected persons residing in jails should receive counseling about HCV infection and be provided linkage to follow-up community healthcare for evaluation of liver disease and treatment upon release. Those whose jail sentence is sufficiently long to complete a recommended course of DAA therapy should receive that treatment while incarcerated. Chronically infected individuals in prison should receive DAA therapy according to AASLD\u2013 IDSA guidance while incarcerated. Jails and prisons should facilitate continuation of HCV therapy for persons on HCV treatment at the time of incarceration. HCV treatment in correctional settings is cost-effective because DAAs halt progression of HCV-related liver disease and decrease the risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma, offsetting future healthcare costs from liver and non-liver complications. Upon release from a correctional facility, HCV-infected persons with advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis should be provided linkage to community healthcare for surveillance for HCV-related complications. To prevent HCV reinfection and reduce the risk of progression of HCV-associated liver disease, correctional facilities should provide harm reduction and evidence-based treatment for underlying substance use disorders. Addressing hazardous alcohol use among persons with chronic HCV in a correctional setting may help slow liver disease progression, decrease HCV transmission, and might reduce recidivism."}]}
