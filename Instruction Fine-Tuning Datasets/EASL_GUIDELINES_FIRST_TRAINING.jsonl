However, in nearly every other country, the projected number of hepatocellular carcinoma and decompensated cirrhosis cases as a result of HCV infection has been increasing and will continue to increase in the absence of treatment and universal screening programs and interventions. A recent study showed that, worldwide, the number of hepatitis C-related deaths as a result of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis increased from a significant number in 1990 to a much higher number in 2013; the proportion of deaths that were attributed to hepatitis C without hepatocellular carcinoma also increased in the same period. In addition to liver-related complications, HCV infection is associated with numerous extrahepatic manifestations. Individuals with chronic HCV infection are more likely to develop cryoglobulinaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, which may lead to the increase in cardiovascular mortality as a result of stroke and myocardial perfusion defects.

HCV virions are 45\u201365 nm in diameter and are enveloped in a lipid bilayer in which two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) are anchored. The envelope surrounds the non-icosahedral nucleocapsid, which is composed of multiple copies of the small basic HCV core protein and contains the positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 9.6 kb, with an open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids.

Glycosaminoglycans and the LDL receptor seem to be involved in low-affinity initial cell binding. Then, E1\u2013E2 interacts with CD81 and scavenger receptor class B member 1, whereas claudin 1, occludin and possibly other molecules, such as claudin 6 or claudin 9, epidermal growth factor receptor or ephrin receptor type A2, are required for cell entry. This multi-receptor complex mediates uptake and defines organ and species specificity. The E2 envelope glycoprotein contains hypervariable regions that play the part of immunodominant neutralization epitopes. Antibodies against these hypervariable regions in patient sera are protective. However, the high variability of HCV with different viral quasi-species in the same patient has so far prevented the development of a successful prophylactic vaccine based on these viral proteins. HCV\u2013receptor complexes are seemingly associated with tight junctions, which enable direct cell\u2013cell transmission. After attachment, HCV entry into cells results in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion between viral and endosomal membranes, which leads to the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The E1 envelope glycoprotein is believed to be the fusogen. Uncoating of the viral nucleocapsid liberates the positive-strand genomic RNA into the cytosol, where it serves as mRNA for synthesis of the HCV polyprotein. The HCV 5\u2032 untranslated region contains an internal ribosome entry site, which controls HCV open reading frame translation. The large precursor polyprotein generated is translated at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where the processing events take place, resulting in the generation of the three structural proteins and the seven non-structural proteins. At least two host cellular peptidases are required for the processing of the HCV structural proteins, whereas two viral peptidases are involved in the processing of the HCV non-structural proteins. The viral proteins remain associated with intracellular membranes after processing. Replication is catalysed by the NS5B protein. The NS5A protein and the helicase-NTPase domain of NS3 play an important regulatory part in virus replication. NS5A acts as a dimer with a basic channel involved in RNA binding. Domain I and domain II of the NS5A protein are required for HCV replication in the replication complex. The phosphorylation state of NS5A modulates the balance between replication and later stages of the HCV life cycle. The NS3 helicase has an important role in separating nascent and template RNA strands, unwinding RNA secondary structures and displacing RNA-binding proteins. NS4B is an integral membrane protein with a role in membrane rearrangements that are induced by HCV proteins, leading to the formation of the \u2018membranous web\u2019 or replication complex that supports and compartmentalizes HCV replication. The positive-strand genome RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a negative-strand intermediate of replication. Then, negative-strand RNAs serve as templates to produce numerous strands of positive polarity that are subsequently used for polyprotein translation, the synthesis of new intermediates of replication or packaging into new virus particles. Various host factors have also been shown to have important functional roles in the HCV life cycle. Cyclophilin A binds to both NS5A and NS5B, thereby inducing the conformational changes that are required for efficient HCV replication. MicroRNA-122, an abundant liver-specific miRNA, binds to two conserved sites in the internal ribosome entry site, which is required for efficient HCV replication and RNA stabilization. Other host factors and pathways are involved in HCV replication, such as phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03b1 or the cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Viral particle formation is initiated by the interaction of the core and NS5A proteins with genomic RNA in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. HCV uses the VLDL production pathway at the later stages of assembly and for release."}]}

A minority of patients develop acute hepatitis C with jaundice, fatigue, right upper abdominal pain or discomfort, or arthralgia (joint pain). If acute HCV infection is associated with acute symptomatic hepatitis C, the chronicity rate is lower than with asymptomatic infection. Acute HCV infection leads to a chronic infection in around 75\u201385% of people; over the course of 20\u201330 years, a proportion of patients will progress to liver cirrhosis and other consequences of cirrhosis, such as hepatic decompensation (which is characterized by ascites, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy) and hepatocellular carcinoma. Before developing symptoms of decompensation, patients may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, muscle and joint pain, or right upper abdominal discomfort, pain or itching. Progression is not necessarily a linear process and can be accelerated by numerous factors, including the age of the patient, male sex, alcohol consumption, and co-infection with other viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV, or other infectious agents, such as schistosomiasis. Many patients with chronic HCV infection remain asymptomatic over years and only become aware of this life-threatening disease once they have already developed cirrhosis. The natural course, and therefore the clinical outcome of acute and chronic HCV infection, is the result of the interplay between the infectious agent and the host, particularly the genetically determined immune system of the patient. The level of viral replication does not predict natural course and outcome of disease, but has been and still is a predictor of treatment response, particularly in the pegylated (PEG)-IFN plus ribavirin era; it is of less importance for DAA treatment. However, viral genotypes differ in clinical course and treatment response. HCV genotype 3 infection seems to run a more aggressive course, including increased risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, than do the other genotypes. Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 were the most difficult to treat in the PEG-IFN plus ribavirin era; patients with HCV genotype 3 infection are the most difficult to treat with DAAs. HCV subtypes also matter. For HCV genotype 1a, the response rates are lower with certain treatment regimens."}]}

The viral populations that constitute the quasi-species differ by amino acid polymorphisms that were generated during replication and subsequently selected based on their effect on the corresponding virus replication capacity. Natural polymorphisms that are present in a region targeted by a DAA may confer reduced susceptibility to the DAA class or the specific DAA. Upon DAA administration, selection of viral variants with reduced susceptibility to the drug (or drugs) defines \u2018viral resistance\u2019. The term \u2018resistance-associated variant\u2019, which has been often used to indifferently characterize substitutions that confer reduced susceptibility to a drug or drug class and the viral variants that carry these substitutions, is incorrect. Substitutions (that is, amino acid changes) that confer resistance are now called RASs, whereas the viral variants that carry these RASs and thus have reduced susceptibility to the DAA are called \u2018resistant variants\u2019. In DAA-based antiviral treatments, each viral population that is present in the quasi-species at baseline evolves following individual kinetics that depend on its amount at treatment initiation, its susceptibility to the antiviral action of the DAAs and its fitness in the presence of the DAA combination. Sensitive viral populations are rapidly eliminated, whereas resistant variants are selected. Failure during treatment is called breakthrough. However, most often treatment failure with current regimens is due to relapse (that is, the recurrence of the virus in the blood after treatment). The majority of viral populations are resistant to one or several of the drugs administered. They are characterized by the presence of class-specific or drug-specific RASs on their genomes. After treatment failure, variants that are resistant to NS3/4A protease inhibitors disappear within a few weeks to months after termination of therapy, whereas variants that are resistant to NS5A inhibitors persist for years, probably forever in most cases."}]}

For the innate immune response, natural killer (NK) cells seem to be involved in resolving HCV infection; it has been shown that certain NK cell receptor genes are associated with viral clearance. For adaptive immune responses, humoral antibody and T cell responses are usually involved in controlling viral infections. For HCV infection, most antibodies seem to have no relevant activity against HCV owing to the high variability of the virus and the quasi-species populations in a single patient. Nevertheless, neutralizing antibodies against certain epitopes may be protective, and rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies has been associated with the control of infection. Most data are available on T cell responses. Broad and multi-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are associated with spontaneous viral clearance, and the persistence of infection is attributed to an insufficient or early loss of T cell responsiveness. Several studies have shown a reduction in the frequency and proportion of subpopulations of T cells in the circulation when acute HCV infection develops into chronicity. Studies in chimpanzees have provided evidence that loss of T helper cell activity results in immune evasion of CD8+ T cells and viral persistence. Experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in chimpanzees resulted in viral persistence until the CD8+ T cell response recovered. HCV has evolved several immune escape or evasion strategies that are linked to the persistence of infection. For example, the HCV NS3/4A protein can efficiently cleave and inactivate two host signalling pathways that react to HCV pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce the IFN pathway. Nevertheless, IFN-stimulated genes are induced during acute HCV infection, but this response is not very effective at clearing the virus. IFN-responsive gene expression remains high in chronic infection, which was associated with poor response to IFN-based treatment. In addition, the evolution to chronic HCV infection is associated with a rapid exhaustion or alteration of immune responses. Mucosal-associated invariant T cell levels are severely reduced in chronic HCV infection. NK cells exhibit alterations in phenotype and function during chronic HCV infection. In addition, liver-infiltrating intrahepatic T cells are phenotypically exhausted and dysfunctional; programmed cell death protein 1 and other markers of functional exhaustion and apoptosis are upregulated. Despite intensive studies of the innate and adaptive immune responses in acute and chronic HCV infection, the precise interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses that determines resolution versus viral persistence remains incompletely understood."}]}

It leads to progressive liver fibrosis and, ultimately, the development of cirrhosis and its complications. Local inflammation seems to be an important driver of fibrogenesis. Chronic HCV infection is associated with chronic hepatic inflammation, as a result of oxidative stress and immune response directed to infected hepatocytes that express viral epitopes. The T helper 2 cell response observed during chronic HCV infection seems to have an important role in chronic inflammation. In addition, numerous growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines are produced in the infected hepatocytes; these factors participate in the recruitment of immune cells, the perpetuation of the local inflammatory response, and the activation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblasts. CD8+ T cell-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes might also have an important role in sustaining inflammation and activating hepatic stellate cells. In addition, the virus itself could participate in the fibrogenic process; indeed, HCV has been suggested to directly interact with hepatic stellate cells and this interaction could accelerate the fibrogenic process. Finally, changes in hepatocyte proliferation during HCV infection also seem to be involved in the progression of liver fibrosis. These changes could be due to direct intracellular interactions between HCV proteins and proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, and to disorganization of cell cycle checkpoints by DNA damage that is induced by the oxidative stress generated during infection. Patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis have a significant cumulative annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis is the main determinant of hepatocellular carcinoma, given that this carcinoma is rare in patients infected with HCV who do not have cirrhosis. HCV infection seems to have a role in the carcinogenic process. Indeed, HCV can hijack molecular pathways involved in the control of the cell cycle. Together, DNA damage and abnormalities of cell cycle and apoptosis control could lead to hepatocyte transformation. In addition, increased proliferation due to the loss of infected cells may participate, together with local inflammation and oxidative stress, in triggering hepatocyte transformation. The role of the local immune response in subsequent tumour progression remains unclear."}]}

Third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are currently used for the detection of anti-HCV antibodies in serum or plasma. These tests are sensitive and specific, can be fully automated and are relatively inexpensive. The serological window between infection and seroconversion when anti-HCV antibodies become detectable is variable and ranges on average between 2 and 8 weeks; thus, testing only for anti-HCV antibodies might miss early infection. Anti-HCV antibodies then persist in patients who develop chronic infection. In patients clearing the virus, anti-HCV antibodies persist for years or even decades. Rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of anti-HCV antibodies are being increasingly used for the screening of infected individuals in middle-to-low-risk populations. An additional advantage is that they can be used not only with serum or plasma but also with whole blood from a finger prick blood sample or crevicular oral fluid. Only rapid diagnostic tests with validated analytical performance (high sensitivity and specificity) must be used. Detection and quantification of HCV RNA are useful to diagnose active infection (characterized by virus replication), identify patients with an indication for therapy and evaluate the response to antiviral therapy, and detect treatment resistance in patients receiving DAAs. HCV RNA detection and quantification are based on real-time PCR or transcription-mediated amplification methods, which are both sensitive and specific. The results are expressed in IU per ml. HCV genotype and, in the case of genotype 1, subtype determination is needed to guide treatment indications (the treatment regimen, the duration of therapy and the addition of ribavirin). The reference method is phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the viral genome, which is generated by population (direct) sequencing. In clinical practice, standardized methods based on direct sequence analysis or reverse hybridization (line probe assay) are used. The HCV core antigen \u2014 epitopes that are expressed on the HCV nucleocapsid protein \u2014 is a surrogate marker of HCV replication and can be detected and quantified in the blood of the patient. Thus, it can be used as an alternative to HCV RNA assays in the diagnosis of infection and antiviral treatment monitoring. HCV core antigen detection and quantification are based on an automated enzyme immunoassay. Its lower limit of detection is equivalent to 500\u20133,000 HCV RNA IU per ml according to the HCV genotype. HCV core antigen represents an interesting and cost-effective alternative to HCV RNA assays to diagnose infection and assess the SVR to antiviral therapy. However, this test is not widely used in clinical practice. Resistance testing is currently based on population sequencing of the drug target region in patients who fail during or, most often, after an IFN-free antiviral regimen. Population sequencing detects variants that represent at least 15% of the viruses in a patient. There is only one commercial assay available in the United States thus far. As a result, most resistance testing is based on in-house methods, the performance and reproducibility of which have not always been properly validated. Resistance tests detect RASs that are present in large proportions (approximately >15%) of HCVs in the blood of patients. Deep sequencing technology is more sensitive (the detection of RASs present in 1% of the viruses). However, population sequencing with a sensitivity of 15% is more appropriate to detect clinically relevant RAS populations that confer DAA resistance."}]}

Following spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance, anti-HCV antibodies persist in the absence of HCV RNA, but titres may wane and finally disappear in some individuals. Anti-HCV antibody testing is not helpful to determine reinfection after treatment, as the antibodies are already present before reinfection in the vast majority of cases. The diagnosis of recently acquired and chronic HCV infection is based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum or plasma by a sensitive, exclusively qualitative or both qualitative and quanti- tative molecular method. An assay with a lower limit of detection \u2264 15 IU/ml is recommended. However, the vast majority of patients with an indication for anti-HCV therapy have an HCV RNA level above 50,000 IU/ml. There is an important need for affordable (less than US$5\u2013US$10) point-of-care or near-care nucleic acid testing assays to ascertain viraemia, which would be applicable for large-scale diagnosis where sensitive HCV RNA assays are not available and/or not affordable, i.e. in low-to middle-income areas, as well as in specific settings in high- income countries. For widespread population testing, a qualitative HCV RNA assay needs only to have a lower limit of detection \u2264 1,000 IU/ml (3.0 Log10 IU/ml). In such settings, the low incidence of a false-negative test for viraemia with these assays is outweighed by the benefit of scaling up access to diagnosis and care. Indeed, a study in patients with chronic hepatitis C due to HCV genotype 1 found only 4 patients out of 2,472 (0.16%) with an HCV RNA level below 1,000 IU/ml. In a report from the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort, 88 out of 2,533 (3.5%) treatment-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C and available quantitative HCV RNA testing results ever had an HCV RNA level less than or equal to 1,000 IU/ml. Young age, excessive alcohol consumption and absence of intravenous drug use were independently associated with an HCV RNA level \u2264 1,000 IU/ml. Among patients from this study with a very low viral level who had another HCV RNA level measurement available more than 6 months after their initial very low viral level, the vast majority had an HCV RNA level >1,000 IU/ml. HCV core antigen in serum or plasma is a marker of HCV replication. Thus, HCV core antigen detection can be used to diagnose viraemia in recently acquired HCV infection, in chronic infection, or after HCV reinfection. HCV core antigen assays are less sensitive than HCV RNA assays for the diagnosis of viraemia (lower limit of detection equivalent to approximately 500 to 3,000 HCV RNA IU/ml, depending on the HCV genotype). They detect HCV core antigen in serum or plasma a few days after HCV RNA becomes detectable during acute HCV infection. In rare cases of chronic infection, HCV core antigen is undetectable in the presence of HCV RNA. The diagnosis of recently acquired hepatitis C can only be made confidently if recent seroconversion to anti-HCV anti- bodies can be documented. Not all patients with recently ac- quired hepatitis C test positive for anti-HCV antibodies at diagnosis. In these cases, recently acquired hepatitis C can be suspected if the clinical signs and symptoms are compatible with an acute hepatitis (ALT level >10 times the upper limit of normal and/or jaundice), in the absence of a history of chronic liver disease or other causes of acute hepatitis, and/or if a likely recent source of transmission is identifiable. In all cases, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen can be detected during the acute phase, although their concentrations may fluctuate with interludes (up to several weeks) of undetectable HCV RNA or HCV core anti- gen. Thus, HCV RNA-negative or HCV core antigen-negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen 12 and 24 weeks after a negative result to confirm definitive clearance. HCV reinfection can occur after spontaneous or treatment- induced HCV clearance when re-exposure to HCV has occurred in those with risk factors for infection. Reinfection is diagnosed based on the reappearance of HCV RNA or HCV core antigen after an SVR and the demonstration (by sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis) that infection is caused by a different genotype or by a distantly related strain of the same genotype from the initial infection. Reinfection should be suspected in cases of a recurrence of HCV infection occurring more than 12 or 24 weeks post-SVR, if risk behaviours have continued."}]}

Accurate HCV prevalence and incidence data are needed to analyse the epidemiology in different regions and to design apposite public health interventions. Thus, HCV screening is required to identify infected individuals and to engage them in care. The optimal regional or national screening approaches should be determined based on the local epidemiology. Screening for HCV infection is based on the detection of anti- HCV antibodies. Either EIA or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be used to screen for anti-HCV antibodies. RDTs use various matrices, including serum and plasma, and can also utilise fingerstick capillary whole blood or oral (crevicular) fluid to facilitate screening without the need for venipuncture, sample centrifugation, freezing and skilled labour. RDTs for anti-HCV antibodies are simple to perform at room temperature without specific instrumentation or extensive training. They have been shown to have excellent sensitivity and specificity compared to EIAs. If anti-HCV antibodies are detected, the presence of HCV RNA by a molecular assay or, alternatively, HCV core antigen by EIA should be determined to identify patients with ongoing infection. Currently, most laboratories use a two-step approach including an antibody test in step 1, followed by phlebotomy and a test for HCV RNA in step 2. This procedure lessens the prospect of a confirmatory HCV RNA test. Reflex testing, i.e. testing for HCV RNA in the sample obtained for anti-HCV antibody testing, has been shown to substantially increase the proportion of anti-HCV antibody-positive patients who are tested for viraemia and receive subsequent linkage to care. Therefore, reflex testing should be applied whenever possible when anti-HCV antibodies are detected.  Dried blood spots (DBSs) can be used to collect and transport whole blood specimens for both detection of anti-HCV anti- bodies by EIA (on the first spot) and reflex HCV RNA testing (on a second spot) in a central laboratory. The methodology is less sensitive than HCV RNA testing in serum or plasma, as quantitative HCV RNA is underestimated by approximately 1.6\u20131.8 Log10 IU/ml on average on DBSs. Confirmation of viraemia by testing for HCV core antigen from whole blood sampled on DBSs is not recommended, as DBSs are insufficiently sensitive for HCV core antigen detection. Indeed, false-negative tests occur in 7%\u201336% of viraemic patients with anti-HCV antibodies. A cartridge-based point-of-care HCV RNA assay has received World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification. This assay can be used with serum, plasma or fingerstick capillary whole blood, with equal performance. The test can be used for reflex testing, but it is too expensive to be used instead of anti- HCV antibody testing for first-line screening. Inexpensive direct tests for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen should be developed to replace screening based on anti-HCV antibody testing by a 1-step direct identification of viraemic individuals, in order to simplify testing algorithms and facilitate shorter pathways to treatment. These tests will require validation for sensitivity and specificity, as well as demonstrable cost- effectiveness, before replacing anti-HCV antibody testing in low- incidence populations."}]}

Diagnosing clinically inapparent cirrhosis (METAVIR score F4) or advanced (bridging) fibrosis (METAVIR score F3) is required, as the choice of treatment regimen and the post-treatment prognosis and surveillance for HCC every 6 months depend on the stage of fibrosis. Patients with cirrhosis need to be assessed for portal hypertension, including oesophageal varices. In chronic hepatitis C, non-invasive methods should be used instead of liver biopsy to assess liver disease severity prior to therapy. Liver stiffness measurement can be used to assess liver fibrosis and the presence of portal hypertension in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Consideration must be given to factors that may adversely affect liver stiffness measurement, such as obesity, high ALT levels, or post-prandial testing. Well established panels of fibrosis biomarkers can also be applied. Among them, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) are generally available, simple and inexpensive, and the information they provide is reliable, but they may lack sensitivity in African populations. Both liver stiffness measurement and biomarkers perform well in the identification of cirrhosis vs. no fibrosis, but they perform less well in resolving intermediate degrees of fibrosis. To do so several cut-off have been studies. The combination of blood biomarkers or the combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improve accuracy. Notably, non-invasive tools should not be used to assess fibrosis stage after therapy, as they are unreliable in this setting. Liver biopsy may be required in cases of known or suspected mixed aetiologies (e.g. metabolic syndrome, alcoholism or autoimmunity)."}]}

Nevertheless, identifying certain genotypes before starting first-line therapy remains useful and may be required where drug procurement or pricing dictates genotype-specific treat- ment, or to optimise treatment regimens. Genotyping/subtyping should be performed with an assay that accurately discriminates subtype 1a from 1b, i.e. an assay using the sequence of the 5\u2019untranslated region plus a portion of another genomic region, generally the core-coding or the NS5B-coding regions. The most widely used, CE-IVD-marked method is based on reverse hybridisation with the second-generation line probe assay. A commercial CE-IVD-marked assay based on deep sequencing is also available. Recently, distinct subtypes of genotypes 1 to 8 that are infrequent in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia (defined as genotype 1 non-1a/1b, genotype 2 non-2a/2b, genotype 3 non-3a, genotype 4 non-4a/4d, and subtypes of genotypes 5 to 8) have been shown to be highly prevalent in certain regions of Africa and Asia and in migrants from these regions. Some (for instance genotypes 1l, 4r, 3b, 3g, 6u, 6v among others) harbour natural polymorphisms that confer inherent resistance to NS5A inhibitors, resulting in unacceptably frequent virological failures in both the resident populations as well as in migrants from these regions.  Thus, HCV genotype and subtype should ideally be determined before treatment in regions where these HCV subtypes are present in substantial proportions, or in migrants from these regions, to optimise treatment regimens. Reverse hybridisation with the line probe assay accurately identifies only genotypes 1 to 6 and subtypes 1a and 1b, but misclassifies most of these infrequent, less treatment-susceptible subtypes. Their accurate determination requires sequence analysis of the NS5B or another coding region of the HCV genome followed by phylogenetic analysis. A commercial CE-IVD-marked assay based on deep sequencing can be used for this purpose, but it requires specific equipment and skills.  If this assay is not available and/or not affordable, only in-house population sequencing (Sanger sequencing) or deep sequencing technologies can be used. These technologies are not available in low- and middle-income settings where these subtypes are prevalent. Virological studies are required in countries in Africa, Asia and South America to determine the epidemiology, distribution and prevalence of HCV subtypes inherently resistant to NS5A inhibitors and thus to optimise treatment decisions without the need for individual HCV genotype and subtype determination."}]}

Drugs that are potent P-gp inducers significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect. Thus, sofosbuvir should not be administered with known inducers of P-gp, such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin or St John\u2019s wort. Other potential interactions may occur with moderate inducers such as rifabutin, oxcarbazepine, rifapentine and modafinil. No significant drug-drug interactions have been reported in studies with the anti- retroviral agents emtricitabine, tenofovir, rilpivirine, efavirenz, darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir, and there are no potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral drugs. \nSofosbuvir-based regimens are contraindicated in patients treated with the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone because of the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Bradycardia has been observed within hours to days of starting the DAA, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed involving P-gp inhibition, protein binding displacement and direct effects of sofosbuvir and/or other DAAs on cardiomyocytes or ion channels. Toxicity is likely the result of a combination of mechanisms. Because of the long half-life of amiodarone, an interaction is possible for several months after discontinuation of amiodarone. If the patient has no cardiac pacemaker in situ, waiting 3 months after discontinuing amiodarone before starting a sofosbuvir-based regimen is recommended. Sofosbuvir-containing regimens have also been implicated in cardiac toxicity in the absence of amiodarone, but this remains controversial. In the absence of specific drug-drug interaction data, caution should be exercised with anti-arrhythmics other than amiodarone."}]}

The sofosbuvir and velpatasvir combination may be co-administered with P-gp, BCRP, OATP and CYP substrates. Caution is required with co-medications that have a narrow therapeutic window, as reflected by the colour coding for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the following text (e.g. for digoxin, dabigatran and ticagrelor). The solubility of velpatasvir decreases as pH increases. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the recommendations concerning the co-administration of antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. For most patients, proton pump inhibitors should be avoided during sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment.

Dose adjustment or additional monitoring is required. Rosuvastatin is contraindicated because of a 19-fold increase in plasma exposure of the statin. As this effect is likely to be attributed more to the BCRP transporter, other drugs that are BCRP substrates, including methotrexate, mitoxantrone, imatinib, irinotecan, lapatinib, sulfasalazine and topotecan, are also not recommended. Dabigatran is contraindicated because of a near 3-fold increase in AUC. This is caused by P-gp inhibition by both velpatasvir and voxilaprevir. Other substrates of P-gp may need to be dose-adjusted or monitored for increased exposure, including digoxin, ticagrelor and carvedilol. Similar caution is required with OATP1B inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, as voxilaprevir plasma exposure increases 19-fold, or with OATP1B substrates, such as edoxaban, as voxilaprevir inhibition is expected to increase exposure to the factor Xa inhibitor. Neither of these combinations are recommended. Concomitant use with medicinal products that are strong P-gp and/or strong CYP inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, St John\u2019s wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin, are contraindicated due to the decrease in sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir exposure with the potential loss in efficacy. Moderate P-gp or CYP inducers (such as modafinil, efavirenz, oxcarbazepine and others) which can also reduce exposure of this DAA are not currently recommended. For women of childbearing age, concomitant use with ethinylestradiol-containing contraception is contraindicated because of the risk of ALT elevations. Progestogen-containing contraception is allowed. The solubility of velpatasvir decreases as pH increases. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the recommendations concerning the co-administration of antacids, H2-receptor an- tagonists and proton pump inhibitors.

For other P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1/3 substrates, dose adjustment should be considered, particularly in narrow therapeutic index drugs. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir concentrations may be decreased by strong P-gp- and CYP3A-inducing drugs such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, St John\u2019s wort or phenytoin, leading to reduced therapeutic effect or loss of virologic response.

Co-medications that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase plasma exposure of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. Similarly, OATP1B1/3 inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, darunavir and lopinavir, may also increase glecaprevir concentrations. The potential for glecaprevir/pibrentasvir to affect other medications is relatively low, although glecaprevir is a weak CYP3A inhibitor (approximately 27% increase in midazolam exposure). There needs to be some caution when co- administering drugs metabolised by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. tacrolimus) or drugs with large dose ranges such as quetiapine, whereas patients on higher doses may need additional monitoring, dose reduction and/or an electrocardiogram. For women of childbearing age, concomitant use with ethinylestradiol-containing contraception is contraindicated because of the risk of ALT elevations. Progestogen-containing contraception is allowed. Similar to other DAAs, the solubility of glecaprevir decreases as pH increases. The Cmax of glecaprevir decreases on average by 64% when co-administered with omeprazole 40 mg. Data indi- cate that this does not affect SVR and license states that no dose changes are recommended. However, prescribing doses of omeprazole greater than 40 mg or equivalent with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been studied and may lead to a greater decrease in glecaprevir concentrations. As with any DAA, reviewing the need for proton pump inhibitor in the first instance must be considered. \nBecause of the mechanisms described above, glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir is contraindicated with atazanavir-containing regimens and is not recommended with other HIV protease inhibitors. Similarly, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz, etravirine and nevirapine are not recommended because of an expected reduction in plasma exposure of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.

pending data with dual pangenotypic regimens (B2). \nSubparagraph Text: In settings where HCV genotype and subtype determination are available and affordable and would not limit access to care, this information remains useful to optimise the results of anti-HCV therapy. Identifying genotype 3a patients with compensated cirrhosis enables reinforced treatment, while identifying patients infected with HCV genotype 1b allows treatment with the less expensive non-pangenotypic combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir. The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir without riba- virin is suboptimal in patients with compensated cirrhosis infected with HCV genotype 3a carrying the Y93H RAS in the NS5A region of the viral genome. The clinical data are supported by in vitro resistance studies in cell culture indicating intermediate-level resistance to velpatasvir conferred by the Y93H RAS alone and high-level resistance when Y93H is combined with other NS5A RASs, in particular at position L31. These in vitro data have been verified in clinical reports, as detailed above.  Thus, if the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir option is chosen, patients infected with genotype 3a with compensated cirrhosis should be treated with either 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus weight-based ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg in patients <75 kg or >=75 kg, respectively) or 12 weeks of the triple fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir. If NS5A resistance testing is available and per- formed, only patients carrying the Y93H RAS on their genome should be treated with either 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus weight-based ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg in patients <75 kg or \u2265 75kg,respectively)or12weeksofthetriplefixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, whereas patients without Y93H can be treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasviralone. A small number of patients infected with HCV genotype 3a with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis have been included in clinical trials with the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (see above). It is still unclear whether 16 weeks of treatment is superior to 12 weeks in treatment-experienced individuals, and real-world studies have been inconclusive. In the phase III EXPEDITION-8 trial, the efficacy of an 8-week treatment regimen in treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 3a and cirrhosis is supported by the inclusion of only 63 patients, with 1 post-treatment relapse. In a real-world study including 11,101 adults treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks, the modified intent-to-treat SVR12 was smaller in the 679 patients infected with genotype 3 (95.8%) than in the 2,900 patients infected with genotypes 1, 2 and 4 (97.6% to 98.5%), but no predictive factors of virological failure have been identified. Thus, recommendations on treatment duration in patients infected with genotype 3a and compensated cirrhosis are based on moderate-quality evidence. Whatever the HCV genotype, whether 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is sufficient in treatment-na\u00efve patients with compensated (Child- Pugh A) cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension, i.e. a liver stiffness >20 kPa with a platelet count <150 \u00d7 109/L (according to the Baveno VI classification), remains to be determined. The fixed-dose combination of grazoprevir/elbasvir yields high SVR12 rates in patients infected with genotype 1b, but 8 weeks of treatment appears to be suboptimal in treatment-na\u00efve patients with F0\u2013F2 fibrosis. Thus, 12 weeks is the recom- mended duration for this combination, regardless of the fibrosis score. \nIn settings where sequence analysis of the NS5A region by means of population sequencing or deep sequencing (cut-off 15%) is available and affordable, it should be performed in patients born in sub-Saharan Africa, China or South-East Asia in order to: (i) identify infrequent HCV subtypes not detected by the line probe assay (defined as genotype 1 non-1a/1b, genotype 2 non-2a/2b, genotype 3 non-3a, genotype 4 non-4a/4d, and subtypes of genotypes 5 to 8) by means of phylogenetic analysis of the sequences generated, and (ii) characterize the NS5A RAS profile to identify patients harbouring viruses inherently resistant to NS5A inhibitors. In the absence of clinical trial or real- world data, patients infected with subtypes 1l, 4r, 3b, 3g, 6u and 6v and patients infected with other infrequent subtypes harbouring \u2265 1 RAS(s) known to confer resistance to NS5A inhibitors (see below) should be treated first-line with the fixed- dose combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, pending data with dual pangenotypic regimens."}]}

Several studies with DAA combinations containing sofosbuvir and an NS5A inhibitor have demonstrated high SVR rates, equivalent in Child-Pugh B and C patients, in individuals with decompensated cirrhosis, together with a beneficial effect of viral clearance on liver function, with significant improve- ments in bilirubin, albumin and international normalised ratio values and, as a result, in model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores in one-third to half of patients. Similar results have been reported in real-world studies. Patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis benefited more from viral clearance in terms of adverse event-free survival at 15 months than those with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. Treatment of HCV infection pre-transplant in patients awaiting liver transplantation has 2 complementary goals: preventing liver graft infection after transplantation and stabilising or improving liver function before transplantation. In some regions, treatment of HCV infection increases access to marginal grafts which may not be made available to patients with ongoing HCV infection. Prevention of liver graft infection substantially facilitates post-transplant management. Improvement of liver function indicates delisting of some patients. However, with the exception of living-donor grafts, the time of transplantation is variable and unpredictable, so a patient may be transplanted before the virus has been cleared. In addition, if delisted, the patient will keep a diseased liver with the risk of subsequent decompensation, HCC occurrence and death, potentially foregoing the opportunity to cure the liver disease and the infection, because cure of HCV infection can be achieved by therapy in the vast majority of patients after transplantation. Several studies assessed whether achieving an SVR prior to liver transplantation would lead to patients being removed from the transplantation list. In a multicentre European real-world study of 142 patients \u2013 followed for a median duration of 34.9 months (IQR 29.0\u201339.5 months) \u2013 receiving IFN-free, DAA-based therapy on the waiting list, 7 patients died on the waiting list, 49% (69/142) were transplanted, and 31% (44/142) were delisted. Thirteen patients were still on the waiting list and 9 were delisted for reasons unrelated to clinical improvement. Four delisted patients were relisted because of HCC in 1 case and ascites in 3 cases. In a French cohort study, including 18 transplant centres with a mean follow-up of 68 weeks (range: 12\u201395 weeks), 18% of patients (14/77) were delisted and 16% (12/ 77) improved. In a similar Spanish study, 24% (29/122) of patients were delisted after DAA-based therapy. No patients with a baseline MELD score >20 were delisted. A retrospective analysis of data from 4 trials on the effects of sofosbuvir-based therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (502 with a Child-Pugh B and 120 with a Child-Pugh C score) identified 5 baseline factors associated with a reduction of Child-Pugh score to A (compensated), including body mass index, encephalopathy, ascites, and serum ALT and albumin levels. In the ASTRAL-4 trial, of the patients with a baseline MELD score <15 treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, with or without ribavirin, 51% (114/223) had an improved MELD score at week 12 post-treatment, 22% (49/223) had no change in their MELD score, and 27% (60/223) had a worse MELD score. Of the patients who had a baseline MELD score \u226515, 81% (22/27) had an improved MELD score, 11% (3/27) had no change in their MELD score, and 7% (2/27) had a worse MELD score. In these studies, the median MELD score improvement was 2 points (range: 1\u201317), but was not always followed by clinical improvement. Data are almost non-existent for patients with the most advanced forms of disease (Child-Pugh score >12 or MELD score >20) who were excluded from the studies. Long-term clinical follow-up data are lacking. Overall, the short-term benefits observed must be balanced with the respective risks of death on the waiting list and likelihood of transplantation. A US study combining real data and modelling suggested that treating HCV before instead of after liver transplantation would only increase life expectancy in patients with a MELD score \u226423\u201327, depending on the United Network for Organ Sharing region. Above a MELD score of 20, the life expectancy benefit of treating before liver transplantation in the model was always less than 1 year, arguing for transplanting individuals with very severe disease prior to HCV therapy. Finally, pre-liver transplantation treatment was reported to be cost-effective for patients without HCC with a MELD score \u226420, while antiviral treatment after liver transplantation was cost- effective in patients with a MELD score >20."}]}

Most cohorts of kidney transplant patients show that HCV positivity is asso- ciated with impaired renal graft and patient survival, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. Impaired graft survival partly reflects increased patient mortality. In addition, specific HCV-related causes, such as glomerulonephritis and increased risk of diabetes, will affect graft outcome. HCV positivity is associated with increased all-cause and liver-related mortality, though cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of patient death. As cirrhosis is an important predictor of poor post- kidney transplant survival after kidney transplantation, it is advisable to assess the stage of liver fibrosis in all HCV-positive kidney transplant candidates. For patients with established cirrhosis and portal hypertension who fail (or are unsuitable for) HCV antiviral treatment, combined liver and kidney trans-plantation must be considered. \nReports demonstrate that DAA therapies effectively cured HCV in 97% (406/418) of kidney transplant recipients, of whom the majority were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens.  In the MAGELLAN-2 study, 100% (20/20) of kidney transplant re- cipients achieved SVR12 after 12 weeks of the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. A few patients required immunosuppressant drug dosage adjustments during therapy. Data on HCV infection after heart transplantation are scarce and controversial, with studies showing unaltered or decreased survival rates in patients infected with HCV. Although the experience with DAAs in this setting is limited, sofosbuvir-based treatments were safe and effective in 12 patients with chronic HCV infection. There is also limited experience with the treatment of lung transplant recipients, but sofosbuvir-based regimens appeared to be safe and efficacious in case reports. No data are available on the impact of HCV infection and its treatment after pancreas or small bowel transplantation. \nExperience accumulated with the treatment of liver trans- plant recipients suggests that solid organ recipients can be treated with the expectation of high SVR rates and acceptable safety. The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is the preferred choice because it does not require immunosuppressant drug dose adjustments. The fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks can also be used, but immunosuppressant drug levels need to be adjusted as needed during and after the end of treatment."}]}

In some European countries, the waiting list mortality rate for orthotopic liver transplantation ranges from 15% to 30%. Thus, accepting grafts from anti-HCV antibody-positive, including HCV RNA-positive, donors increase access to organ transplantation and is cost-effective. The number of anti-HCV antibody-positive donors that are HCV RNA-negative could increase substantially with the advent of highly efficacious DAA-based antiviral therapies. Rare cases of transmission after liver transplantation have been reported from anti-HCV-positive but HCV RNA-negative donors, possibly because of acute infection during the \u201cwindow\u201d period. In contrast, the risk of HCV transmission is very high in solid organ transplantation recipients of HCV RNA-positive donors. Post-transplant treatment with HCV DAAs yields very high rates of SVR in these patients. However, transplanting solid organs from HCV viraemic donors to uninfected recipients has been complicated by acute HCV infection in a few patients, with consequent fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and de novo glomerular disease. \nAssessing liver graft quality, through visual inspection and histological examination, is crucial when accepting anti-HCV antibody-positive grafts. New techniques, such as elastography or liquid biopsy, will soon become available for this purpose. Grafts with advanced fibrosis (F3) must be declined, whereas those with no or mild fibrosis (F0\u2013F1) are accepted. It is still unclear whether grafts with moderate fibrosis (F2) should be accepted for transplantation. Future data on fibrosis progression following early post-transplant therapy with HCV DAAs is needed before liberally accepting these grafts. The use of anti-HCV antibody-positive organs has substantially increased since the approval of DAA-based combination regimens, although a substantial number of grafts are still discarded. Some centres, particularly in areas with high HCV positivity rates as a result of the \u201copioid epidemic\u201d and high rates of mortality on the waiting list, have started using HCV RNA-positive livers for non- infected liver and kidney graft recipients, with good preliminary results. In a recent study, early liver graft outcomes were similar in recipients of HCV RNA-positive and -negative donors. In another study, a life expectancy benefit was observed in liver recipients with MELD scores \u226520, with the maximum benefit observed in those with a MELD score \u226528. HCV-positive organs should not be offered to non-infected recipients with a MELD score <20 if access to anti-HCV therapy is not guaranteed. The transplantation of HCV-negative recipients with HCV- positive kidneys is now also possible with the availability of all- oral DAA-based therapies. In a trial including 10 kidney transplant candidates receiving HCV genotype 1-infected kidneys, the median time on the waiting list before entering the trial once eligible was very short (58 days, IQR: 53\u2013100) and all recipients achieved SVR after DAA-based treatment, with acceptable graft function at 6 months of follow-up. Other data indicate very high SVR rates after DAA treatment of HCV-negative recipients of HCV- positive kidneys treated with DAAs post-transplant. A study from the Organ Procurement Transplant Network compared the short-term outcomes of renal transplantation from 196 HCV RNA- positive donors with 352 anti-HCV antibody-positive, HCV RNA- negative donors and 36,934 donors without HCV markers. Compared to the latter group, delayed graft function was less frequent in transplants performed using HCV-seropositive, non-viraemic and viraemic donors. The recipients of HCV RNA-positive grafts had better allograft function at 6 months post-transplant, while there was no statistical difference in the overall graft fail- ure risk at 12 months between the different groups. Whether a prophylactic or preemptive approach (starting DAAs prior to or on the day of transplant) or a delayed approach (starting treatment after confirmation of recipient viraemia) is best remains to be determined. The efficacy of ultra-short-term perioperative DAA prophylaxis was tested in HCV-negative recipients of HCV RNA-positive kidney transplants in a single-centre pilot trial. Three of 10 patients (30%) receiving 1 dose of sofusbuvir/velpa- tasvir pre-transplant followed by 1 dose at day 1 post-transplant were infected. Three of another 40 patients (7.5%) receiving additional sofosbuvir/velpatasvir doses at days 2 and 3 post- transplant (total: 4 doses) were infected. Five of the 6 infected patients cleared HCV after another course of DAA treatment. These results are encouraging, but longer preemptive therapy is probably required to achieve 100% prevention of infection. Positive results have also been reported in heart transplant recipients grafted with an HCV RNA-positive organ. In an open-label study, preemptive administration of glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir resulted in expedited organ transplantation, rapid HCV suppression, prevention of chronic HCV infection and excellent early allograft function in patients receiving HCV- infected donor hearts. In another study, 36 patients received lung transplantation and 8 received heart transplantation from HCV-infected donors. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir was preemptively administered to the recipients for 4 weeks, beginning within a few hours after transplantation. All of the first 35 patients who had completed 6 months of follow-up achieved an SVR, with excellent graft function.  In a recent phase III, single-centre, open-label study, 30 transplant recipients (lung, kidney-heart and kidney-pancreas) received both glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and ezetimibe, an unapproved HCV entry blocker, once prior to transplantation and daily for 7 days post-transplant. All of them had undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after transplantation.  Larger studies are required to evaluate the optimal duration of antiviral therapy in recipients of HCV RNA-positive organs. An informed consent must be signed by the recipient before transplanting an organ from a donor positive for anti-HCV antibodies, whether HCV RNA-positive or -negative."}]}

They show that DAA-induced SVR is associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of de novo HCC, of all-cause mortality and of liver-related mortality in the mid- to long-term. However, the risk of HCC is not abolished by an SVR. A large-scale study from the Veterans Administration has shown that an increased risk for HCC persists up to 10 years after HCV eradication in patients with cirrhosis or a high FIB-4 score at HCV treatment baseline, justifying post-SVR surveillance in these patients. \nIFN has been shown to improve outcomes following ablation or resection of HCC. Whether the high rates of SVR achieved with new IFN-free regimens have a beneficial or deleterious effect on the risk of recurrence following resection or ablation of HCC has been debated, following publication of a large number of generally small-scale, retrospective studies with contradictory results. A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta- regression including 13,875 patients from 41 studies (26 studies on HCC occurrence and 17 on HCC recurrence) concluded that there is no evidence for a difference in the incidence of de novo HCC occurrence or recurrence following an SVR after DAA- or IFN- based therapy. In addition, a retrospective US cohort study including 797 patients with HCV-related HCC who achieved a complete response to resection, local ablation, transarterial chemo- or radio-embolisation or radiation therapy has shown that DAA treatment of HCV infection was associated with a significant reduction in the overall risk of death. An expert review was produced by the American Gastroentero- logical Association Institute. After an exhaustive review of the literature, the experts concluded that DAA treatment of HCV infection is associated with a reduction in the risk of incident de novo HCC, with a similar relative risk reduction in patients with and without cirrhosis. The presence of active HCC is associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in SVR rates with DAA therapy. There are no conclusive data that DAA therapy is associated with increased or decreased risk, differential time to recurrence, or aggressiveness of recurrent HCC in patients with a complete response to HCC therapy. Thus, DAA therapy should not be withheld from such patients. DAA therapy can conveniently be deferred 4\u20136 months in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child- Pugh A) cirrhosis, to consolidate treatment and confirm a response to HCC therapy in patients treated with curative intent."}]}

Mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with clonal B lymphocyte expansion may cause a systemic vasculitis, in which multiple organs are involved because of vascular deposition of immune complexes. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been used for both skin and organ involvement. In a prospective international multicentre cohort study, an SVR rate of 87% was achieved in 148 patients with cryoglobulin- associated vasculitis; DAA therapy induced a complete clinical response (improvement of all organs involved at baseline and absence of clinical relapse) in 73% (106/148) of cases, a partial response (improvement in some but not all organs involved at baseline) in 23% (33/148) of cases, and no response in 5% (7/148) of cases. Cryoglobulins were no longer detected in 53% of patients. Symptoms of purpura were cleared from 97% of patients, renal involvement from 91% of patients, arthralgias from 86% of patients, and neuropathy from 77% of patients. Factors associated with no or partial response were a severe form of cryoglobulin- associated vasculitis and peripheral neuropathy. There is a significant association between persistent hepatitis C and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Low-grade lymphomas are treated with rituximab with or without corticosteroids, whereas high-grade lymphomas receive standard-of-care R-CHOP regi- mens. The outcome of the latter appears to be enhanced with rituximab, although rituximab may increase viral replication. Several cases of remission of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been reported after successful antiviral therapy. In an Italian observational study, antiviral treatment with DAAs was associated with remission of aggressive lymphomas in HCV-infected patients and was found to be an independent predictor of disease-free survival when combined with specific chemo-therapy. The relationship between successful DAA-based antiviral treatment and regression of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was confirmed in a systematic review and meta-analysis pooling 13 studies. The association of chronic HCV infection and chronic renal disease is well established.  A spectrum of histopathological lesions has been reported. The most frequent is type I membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, usually in the context of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, vasculitic involvement and interstitial nephritis may also occur. Therapeutic approaches for HCV-associated renal disease include antiviral therapy, rituximab, plasma exchange, corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.  In a retrospective cohort study in 45,260 US Veterans treated for their HCV infection with DAAs, the risk of glomerulonephritis was significantly reduced following an SVR. Although the data are scarce with the most recent DAA combinations, remissions from glomerular disease have been reported in patients with SVR."}]}

Diverse groups of patients with renal disease require consideration when treat- ment of hepatitis C is indicated. These include patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 with severely reduced renal function (eGFR = 15\u201329 ml/min/1.73 m2) or those with CKD stage 5 (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis); post-renal transplant patients; patients with cirrhosis with renal impairment (chronic renal disease, hepatorenal syndrome, acute kidney injury, acute- on-chronic liver failure); post-liver transplant patients with calcineurin-induced renal impairment; or patients with mixed essential cryoglobulinemia with renal damage. In some of these groups, renal function can potentially improve with antiviral treatment. However, organ recovery may be delayed after an SVR in patients with cryoglobulinemia. In the haemodialysis population, HCV infection is associated with an increased risk of all- cause and liver-related mortality. However, cardiovascular dis- ease remains the main cause of death in patients on dialysis, irrespective of HCV status. \nIn patients with renal impairment, including those with CKD stage 4 or 5 and patients with end-stage renal disease on hae- modialysis, no dose adjustments are necessary for any of the approved DAA combinations. These patients should therefore be treated according to the general recommendations provided earlier. EXPEDITION-4 was a phase III trial conducted in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD treated with the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks. Among the 104 patients, 23 were infected with genotype 1a, 29 with genotype 1b, 2 with another genotype 1 subtype, 17 with genotype 2, 11 with genotype 3, 20 with genotype 4, 1 with genotype 5 and 1 with genotype 6. Twenty patients (19%) had compensated cirrhosis and 42% were treatment-experienced. The SVR12 rate was 98% (102/104, 2 virological failures). An integrated analysis of phase II and III studies in which glecaprevir and pibren- tasvir were administered for 12 weeks in 2,238 patients infected with genotypes 1 to 6 showed an overall SVR rate of 98% (2,188/ 2,238), with no difference between patients with CKD stage 1\u20133 (98%; 2,087/2,135) or stage 4\u20135 (98%; 101/103). In a Japanese prospective multicentre study assessing 8 or 12 weeks of gle- caprevir and pibrentasvir, SVR was achieved in 100% (32/32) of patients with CKD stage 4, 99% (108/109) of patients with CKD stage 5 and 99% (99/100) of patients on haemodialysis. In a meta-analysis of real-world studies assessing the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C, the SVR12 rate was 99% (58/59) in those with CKD stage 4 or 5. Thus, the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir is the treatment of choice for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stage 4 or 5 CKD (including those on haemodialysis). The safety of sofosbuvir-based regimens has been questioned in patients with severe renal dysfunction (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), as sofosbuvir is eliminated mainly by the renal route. However, sofosbuvir-based regimens have been reported to be safe and effective in patients with severe CKD, including patients on haemodialysis, in several studies. Based on pharmacokinetic data obtained from studies involving HCV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, the current product licence indicates that, although safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/ min/1.73 m2) and end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available. The safety of the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 59 patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis. In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 was increased 20-fold, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not higher than expected in patients with end- stage renal disease. Voxilaprevir exposure is not expected to be meaningfully altered in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Thus, it can be used in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis. Protease inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B and C) cirrhosis and CKD; thus, these patients should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Ribavirin can be used in patients with mild to moderate (eGFR \u226530 ml/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, whereas patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) should be treated for 24 weeks without ribavirin. In the C-SURFER trial, 55 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b with stage 4 or 5 CKD, including 75% on haemodialysis, were treated with grazoprevir and elbasvir for 12 weeks. The SVR12 rate was 92% (54/59; 1 relapse). The frequencies of renal system adverse events were comparable between treatment groups. A real-world study using the same regimen in American patients with various stages of CKD showed similarly high SVR rates in patients infected with genotype 1b, regardless of the severity of renal disease. For patients on dialysis, who already have end-stage renal disease, the optimal timing of treatment is an important consideration, i.e. pre- or post-renal transplantation if they are candidates for renal transplantation, while the risks vs. the benefits must be considered if renal transplantation is not possible. HCV-associated liver damage may be accelerated by immunosuppression. Antiviral therapy should be considered for all patients on haemodialysis. Studies showing high efficacy and safety of IFN-free anti-HCV regimens in kidney transplant recipients suggest that these patients can also be transplanted and treated for their HCV infection after kidney transplantation with a high probability of cure. Decisions regarding timing of HCV treatment in relation to kidney transplantation should consider the type of donor (living or deceased), waiting list times by donor type, centre-specific policies regarding the use of kidneys from HCV-infected deceased donors, HCV genotype, and severity of liver fibrosis. If receiving a kidney from an HCV RNA- positive donor increases the chance of undergoing trans- plantation, the patient can be transplanted and treated for HCV infection after transplantation."}]}

Chronic HCV infection is also frequent in individuals with sickle cell anaemia, with a more rapid course of liver disease because of the concurrent iron overload. Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of either factor VIII or IX in haemophilia A and B, respectively. People with haemophilia exposed to non-virally inactivated concentrates prior to 1985 had an almost 100% chance of being infected with HCV with their first exposure to concentrate. There are numerous other inherited bleeding dis- orders treated with concentrates, including von Willebrand disease and deficiencies of fibrinogen and factors II, VII, X, XI and XIII. Progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with haemophilia is similar to that in HCV-positive individuals in the general population. Transjugular liver biopsies have enhanced the safety of the procedure. Non-invasive methods can be utilised to monitor disease progression. Death from liver failure in HCV-positive individuals was among the commonest causes of death in patients with inherited bleeding disorders. The management of chronic hepatitis C in haemophilia is the same as in the non-haemophilic population. \nTrials with antiviral therapy have been published in patients with inherited blood disorders.  In a Lebanese study, 7 patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and HCV infection were treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. All of them achieved SVR and treatment was well tolerated.  In the C-EDGE IBLD study, the fixed- dose combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir was administered for 12 weeks in patients infected with genotype 1b with haemoglobinopathies including sickle cell anaemia, b-thalassemia, haemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease. One patient out of 4 had cirrhosis and patients with a haemoglobin level <7 g/dl were excluded. SVR12 was achieved in 96% (44/46; 1 relapse) of cases, while haemoglobin levels were maintained on treatment. In a recent Italian multicentre study, SVR was achieved in 99% (193/ 195) of patients with haemophilia and chronic HCV reinfection receiving treatment with various DAA regimens following the EASL recommendations. No serious adverse events were observed. Over 100 liver transplants have been carried out in patients with haemophilia worldwide. Factor VIII/IX concentrate is administered immediately before the surgery, either by bolus injection or continuous infusion, and for the immediate post- operative period for 12\u201348 hours, after which no further concentrate is required. Coinfection with HIV and HCV is not a contraindication to liver transplantation in haemophilia. The indications for liver transplantation in patients with haemophilia are the same as in those without haemophilia, but the procedure has the major advantage of producing a phenotypic cure of the haemophilia, as a result of factor VIII production by the transplanted liver."}]}

Mother-to-infant transmission is the major route of infection with an estimated rate of transmission of 4%\u2013 8%. The transmission rates are higher from HIV-HCV-coinfected mothers, with an estimated rate of perinatal transmission of 8%\u201315%. The opioid epidemic in the United States is also associated with an increasing ongoing risk of HCV transmission from mothers to their children.  As a result, all children born to HCV-infected women should be tested for HCV infection from the age of 18 months. The status of at-risk children should be checked. Other sources of acquisition, including nosocomial transmission, occur in children and adolescents. Adolescents are at risk via injecting drug use. Symptoms of chronic HCV infection in the paediatric population are usually absent. Cirrhosis and HCC are rare in children.  However, liver disease may progress during early life. Individuals with thalassemia and iron overload, as well as those with HIV coinfection and childhood haematological or solid tumours receiving chemotherapy, may develop advanced hepatic fibrosis. Childhood obesity, alcohol use and/or viral coinfections may contribute to advancing liver disease. Dose-finding and safety have been assessed in an international trial of the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and vel- patasvir in patients aged 6\u201317 years infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 4. Adolescents between 12 and 17 years received 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir for 12 weeks, either as a single 400 mg/100 mg tablet or as two 200 mg/50 mg tablets each day. Children between 6 and 11 years received half of the adult/adolescent dose for 12 weeks, i.e. 200 mg of sofosbuvir and 50 mg of velpatasvir each day, either as a single 200 mg/50 mg tablet or as 4 oral granules containing 50 mg of sofosbuvir and 12.5 mg of velpatasvir. Plasma concentra- tions of sofosbuvir, its metabolite GS-331007 and velpatasvir measured at several time points during the first 12\u201324 hours of administration were comparable to those observed in adult populations receiving the full-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. SVR12 was achieved in 95% (97/102; 1 virological failure) of adolescents aged 12\u201317 years and in 93% (68/73; 1 virological failure) of children aged 6\u201311 years. Eight patients were lost-to-follow-up and 2 additional patients discontinued treatment due to spitting up or an inability to swallow the drug. Equivalent safety was reported compared to the adult popula- tion. Children aged 3\u20135 years received 200 mg/50 mg or 150 mg/37.5 mg of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir according to body weight \u226517 kg or <17 kg, respectively, either as a single 200 mg/50 mg tablet or as 4 or 3 oral granules containing 50 mg of sofosbuvir and 12.5 mg of velpatasvir, respectively. The SVR12 rate was 83% (34/41). There was no virological failure, failures being related to loss to follow-up or early treatment discontinuation (data on file communicated to the panel by Gilead). The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, and nausea in adolescents; vomiting, cough and headache in 6- to 11-year-old children; and vomiting in 3- to 5-year-old children. The DORA clinical trial was performed in children and ado- lescents infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 who received the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 8 to 16 weeks. In the first part of the study, all 47 adolescents aged 12\u201317 years were treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and 100% of them achieved SVR12. The safety profile and exposure were consistent with that in adults, while pharmacokinetics exposures of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were comparable to exposures in adults. In the second part of the DORA study, 80 children aged 3\u201311 years received film-coated granules of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir mixed together in a small amount of food for daily administration in sachets containing 50 mg of glecaprevir and 20 mg of pibrentasvir: 250 mg/100 mg (5 sachets) of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, respectively, for children aged 9\u201311 years weighing 30\u201344 kg; 200 mg/80 mg (4 sachets) for children aged 6\u20138 years weighing 20\u201329 kg; 150 mg/60 mg (3 sachets) for children aged 3\u20135 years weighing 12\u201319 kg. This formulation has not yet received regulatory approval. Pharmacokinetic exposures were within those reported for adult and adolescent patients receiving the approved dose of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. The most common adverse events were headache (14%) and vomiting (14%). The SVR12 rate was 96% (77/80; 1 relapse in a 9-year- old Asian patient infected with HCV subtype 3b who received 8 weeks of treatment) (data on file communicated to the panel by Abbvie)."}]}

Data in some parts of the world showed a doubling of incidence between 2006 and 2014, but the true global incidence is difficult to identify as many cases remain undiagnosed. In most regions, universal screening of HCV in pregnant females is not performed. \nModels have shown that universal prenatal HCV screening improves health outcomes in women with HCV infection, im- proves identification of HCV in at-risk neonates, and is cost- effective. Screening remained cost-effective at a prevalence of 0.07%, which is translatable to a European population.  Universal HCV testing in pregnant women is therefore recommended as part of the strategy for global elimination. Testing is recommended at early stages of the pregnancy alongside other prenatal tests to allow for appropriate referral, but it can be carried out at any stage. HCV infection may influence the outcome of pregnancy, leading to a higher incidence of preterm births and a higher incidence of intrauterine foetal death, preterm delivery and small-for-gestational age. Higher rates of antepartum and post- partum haemorrhage, gestational diabetes, or premature rupture of membranes have been reported. Chronic HCV infection has also been linked with higher rates of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Women identified with HCV infection when pregnant should, where possible, be looked after by a multidisciplinary team involving hepatology, obstetric and paediatric input. Currently there are no large-scale published data on the safety and efficacy of HCV DAAs in pregnant women and none are licensed for use in pregnancy. A phase I study looking at the safety and virological response to the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in 9 pregnant women showed that all achieved SVR with a low incidence of adverse events. A case series of 15 women in India was also presented, as well as incidences of accidental conception during treatment, both with positive outcomes.  Whilst antivirals are used in HIV and HBV infection for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, there is currently no data on the use of DAAs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HCV. As a result, HCV treatment during pregnancy cannot currently be recommended. Treatment can be considered during pregnancy, or in the case of accidental conception during treatment, only on a case-by-case basis after a thorough discussion with the patient about the potential risks and benefits and in a joined-up approach with liver and obstetric services. An ongoing, open-label, prospective study is being conducted at 2 maternity hospitals in Australia in pregnant women who will be treated with a 12-week course of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether the pharmacokinetic profiles of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Secondary endpoints will include SVR12, maternal and neonatal safety, neonatal HCV transmission, and maternal preferences and acceptability of HCV treatment. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in women with HCV as available data show that it does not increase the risk of mother- to-child transmission. In the case of bleeding or cracked nipples, due to the risk of HCV transmission from blood exposure, consideration should be given to stopping and specialist input should be provided for these women."}]}

In Europe, two-thirds of the HCV burden is attributable to injecting drug use. The prevalence of chronic HCV infection among people who recently injected drugs is approximately 40%.  Recommendations for HCV testing in this population are based on the high prevalence of infection, the demonstration that awareness of their HCV status induces sustained protective behavioural changes, the potential public health benefit of reducing transmission by treating current drug users, and the proven benefits of care and treatment in reducing HCV-related morbidity and mortality.  Because of the high incidence of HCV infection in PWIDs and the benefits outlined above, HCV testing should be performed at least annually and following a high-risk episode in PWIDs. It has been shown that OST is associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of new HCV acquisition. This effect is increased to 74% by the concomitant use of clean drug injecting equipment. However, global coverage of OST and needle and syringe programme interventions is low. A combination of prevention strategies, including HCV \u201ctreatment as prevention\u201d, are critical to substantially reduce HCV transmission and prevalence in these populations, especially in settings with high existing harm reduction coverage. The goals of HCV treatment in PWIDs are to prevent the com- plications of chronic hepatic and extrahepatic HCV-associated disease, but also to prevent onward transmission of HCV. Among patients receiving OST and those with recent injecting drug use, pangenotypic DAA therapy has been demonstrated to be safe and effective and does not require specific methadone or buprenorphine dose adjustment. However, monitoring for signs of opioid toxicity or withdrawal should be undertaken. In an integrated analysis of the 3 ASTRAL-1 to 3 trials, OST did not impact completion, adherence, safety or the SVR rate (96% [49/51] in patients on OST vs. 98% [966/984] in patients not on OST). The lack of difference between patients on or not on OST was confirmed in an extension of the previous study in which patients treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in the phase III ION trials and with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in the phase III POLARIS trials were added. The SIMPLIFY study included only patients with recent (last 6 months) injecting drug use receiving or not receiving OST and treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks. Adherence was 94% and SVR12 was obtained in 94% (97/103; no virological breakthrough, 1 reinfection). Drug use within the month preceding the start of therapy was reported by 74% of patients. SVR12 in this subgroup was 96% and did not differ from that in patients who did not report drug use in the preceding month (94%). However, there were 4 deaths during the study period because of illicit drug overdose (5.0 per 100 person-years), highlighting the drug use comorbidity and mortality risk in this population.  In an integrated analysis, data were pooled from 7 phase III trials of 8 or 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 6. Among 1,819 patients, 5% and 34% were recent or former drug users, respectively, whereas the remaining 61% were non-drug users. Treatment adherence and completion were \u2265 96%, regardless of drug use status. SVR12 was achieved by 93% (91/98), 97% (591/610) and >99% (1,106/1,111) of recent, former, and non-drug users, respectively. No HCV reinfections were reported among recent drug users.  Another integrated analysis included 2,256 patients from 8 phase II and III clinical trials with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, of whom 157 patients (7%) were receiving OST. SVR12 rates in OST and non-OST patients were 96% (151/157; 1 relapse) and 98% (2055/2099; 22 relapses), respectively. In the C-EDGE CO-STAR trial in patients on OST, treatment with grazoprevir and elbasvir also yielded a high SVR rate in patients infected with genotype 1b. These results were confirmed in several real-world cohort studies. In the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort, PWIDs and patients on OST achieved high SVR rates on sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, although slightly lower than people not injecting drugs. This study also highlighted the need for additional measures to prevent loss-to-follow-up and overdose-related deaths among PWIDs. Meanwhile, a pooled analysis of ongoing post-marketing real- world studies showed high SVR rates with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in recent drug users (98%, 98/100; no virological failure), former drug users (98%, 317/324; 1 breakthrough and 3 relapses) and non- drug users (99%,1,010/1,022; 5 breakthroughs and 6 relapses). In the German Hepatitis C registry study, SVR was lower in patients on OST than in those not receiving OST (85% and 91%, respectively), as a result of the higher rate of patients lost to follow-up in the former group. Per protocol SVR was similar in both groups (96% and 95%, respectively). A systematic review and meta-analysis of both observational studies and clinical trials, including 3,634 patients from 38 studies, showed high SVR rates in PWIDs with recent drug use, including those who still inject, and in individuals on OST.  Altogether, these studies suggest that pangenotypic regimens are efficacious and well tolerated in patients with active or recent drug use, including those on OST. However, it is critical that HCV care in PWIDs be integrated within a framework that addresses drug-related harms, prevents overdose mortality, ad- dresses social inequalities, and improves drug user health. Injecting drug use and risk behaviours appear to remain stable or decrease during and following DAA-based HCV treatment.  Successful models have been multidisciplinary and often peer-supported in community-based clinics, drug treatment clinics, correctional facilities, needle-syringe programmes, supervised consumption rooms, specialised hospital-based clinics and primary care. Reinfection may occur after successful antiviral treatment in active drug users. A recent meta-analysis of 36 studies reported a follow-up of 6,311 person-years.  The overall rate of HCV reinfection was 5.9/100 person-years among people with recent injecting or non-injecting drug use, 6.2/100 person-years among people recently injecting drugs, and 3.8/100 person-years among those receiving OST. Reinfection rates were comparable following IFN-based and DAA-based therapy (5.4/100 person- years vs. 3.9/100 person-years, respectively). Higher reinfection rates were observed in people with recent drug use receiving or not OST than in people receiving OST with no recent drug use. In meta-regression analysis, longer follow-up was associated with a lower reinfection rate, suggesting higher reinfection risk early post-treatment.  Thus, patients who injected drugs during the year preceding treatment should be offered ideally bi-annual, at least annual testing for reinfection after DAA-induced SVR. In addition, testing should be offered after risk behaviour. Retreatment should be offered in case of positivity to avoid continued transmission. Aiming at eliminating HCV is crucial in PWIDs. Modelling suggests that such elimination can be achieved by scaling up treatment in this population. The prevention benefits of treatment will be greatest when delivered in combination with OST and needle and syringe programmes."}]}

As a result, HCV is common in correctional facilities. In addition, harm reduction is not available to most prisoners. Therefore, the incidence of HCV infection among prisoners who use drugs during incarceration can be very high. Drug use in prisons is increasing. Recent drug use has been reported by 30% of those who are incarcerated in Europe. The incidence of HCV infection has been estimated to be of the order of 16 per 100 person-years (range 1\u201334) among prisoners with a history of drug use. Despite this high incidence and prevalence, access to HCV testing and treatment in prisons is generally limited, but it is improving in countries with dedicated test-and- treat programmes. \nOpt-in testing is commonly provided in European prisons. However, mathematical modelling in US prisons has suggested that opt-out testing is the most cost-effective approach, as opposed to risk-based testing. Short prison stays and frequent transfers are important barriers to treatment in prison. Shorter treatment durations with current DAAs have made HCV treatment during incarceration more feasible than it was during the IFN era. Nevertheless, ensuring the care continuum in prison is a challenge. \nThe feasibility of treating HCV in prison has been demonstrated in a study from Australia in which a nurse-led model of care was provided. HCV RNA was detected in 562 patients and 416 commenced treatment with DAAs. SVR12 in the intent-to- treat analysis was 72% (301/416). However, most failures were due to loss of follow-up after release. Thus, among 313 persons treated and followed, per protocol SVR12 was achieved in 96% of cases (301/313; 11 relapses and 1 reinfection). In a study performed in English prisons, DBS testing, nurse-led in reach and consultations delivered by telemedicine were offered. HCV RNA was found in 374 prisoners, of whom 266 started DAA treatment. Among 128 individuals with follow-up data, 87% (111/128; 6 relapses, 11 incomplete treatments) achieved SVR12. Among 48 persons with long-term follow-up, 21 (44%) were reinfected. In many countries, OST is available only for individuals who started treatment before their incarceration, while needle- syringe exchange programmes are available in a limited number of prisons in Europe. Prison employees are often opposed to needle-syringe exchange programmes in prison, due to a perceived risk introduced by providing sharp utensils in a prison. Even when needle-syringe exchange programmes are in place, prisoners may be unwilling to use this programme if participation requires disclosure of drug use."}]}

Retreatment of patients who failed can be optimised based on RAS testing. Therefore, specialist advice can improve outcomes after retreatment for DAA failures. \nThe RASs that have been shown to confer reduced susceptibility to the corresponding drug classes in vitro and/or that have been reported to be selected by DAA-containing therapies in patients who failed to achieve SVR. These many RASs and several alternative substitutions at the same positions can be present prior to retreatment in patients previously exposed to DAAs. Based on the current state of knowledge, no specific algorithms to guide retreatment decisions can be derived from these observations. Thus, retreatment must be guided either by the knowledge of which drugs were administered in previous treatment courses if no resistance test is available or, if resistance testing is performed, by probabilities of response according to the resistance profile observed and the treating team\u2019s experience.  Two phase III trials, POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the triple combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks in patients who failed to achieve SVR with a DAA-based regimen, including patients exposed to protease and/or NS5A inhibitors. POLARIS-1 included patients who failed a prior NS5A-containing treatment, of whom 46% had cirrhosis. The overall retreatment SVR rate was 96% (253/263; 1 virological breakthrough and 6 relapses) in patients receiving sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks. SVR was more frequent in patients without than in those with cirrhosis (99% vs. 93%, respectively). Neither the HCV genotype, nor the RAS profile at retreatment baseline had an influence on the response. Among the 7 patients with virological failure, NS3 RASs (Q80K) were present in 2 cases and NS5A RASs (at position 30 or 93) in 6 cases at retreatment baseline. Additional NS5A RASs were present in only 2 of them at virological failure. POLARIS-4 included patients who had previously failed to achieve SVR following a DAA-based treatment course not including an NS5A inhibitor, of whom 46% had cirrhosis. The overall retreatment SVR12 rate was 98% (178/182; 1 relapse) in patients randomised to receive sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks, compared to 90% (136/151; 1 virological breakthrough, 14 relapses) in similar patients treated with only sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for the same duration. Neither the HCV genotype, nor the RAS profile at retreatment baseline had an influence on the response in patients receiving the triple combination. Indeed, SVR was achieved in 98% (42/43) of patients without detectable RASs and in 97% (199/205) of patients with any NS3 and/or NS5A RASs. The patients who relapsed after retreatment had no detectable RASs at baseline or at virological failure. Several real-world studies assessing the efficacy of the triple combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in the retreatment of DAA-containing regimen failures confirmed the high SVR rates achieved with this regimen, regardless of patient gender, body mass index, HCV genotype and baseline HCV RNA.  The only pre-treatment parameter associated with a slightly lower SVR rate was cirrhosis.  Thus, the triple combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir appears as the treatment of choice for retreatment of patients who failed to achieve SVR after an IFN-free, DAA-based treatment course. Retreatment studies are ongoing with the triple combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in patients aged 12\u201317 years. No formulation will be available for younger children. The MAGELLAN-1 trial showed that the combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir does not have a high enough barrier to resistance to achieve optimal SVR rates in patients previously exposed to an NS5A inhibitor.  In a randomised study of 177 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection who received previous treatment with sofosbuvir plus an NS5A inhibitor, 16 weeks treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir induced SVR12 in 86\u201397% of patients. Treatment failed in 7.3% of patients with genotype 1a infection. Treatment-selected RASs in the NS3 and NS5A regions were observed in 9 and 10 patients with treatment failure, respectively.  Overall, the combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir is not indicated in the retreatment of patients who failed a prior DAA-containing regimen, particularly if this regimen contained an NS5A inhibitor. Instead, a triple combi- nation of sofosbuvir with an NS3 protease inhibitor and an NS5A inhibitor appears to be better suited to retreatment of DAA-exposed patients. Because pibrentasvir has a higher barrier to resistance than all other approved NS5A inhibitors in vitro, the triple combination of sofosbuvir and the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir could offer an interesting alternative for retreatment of difficult-to-cure patients, such as those with complex NS5A RAS patterns and/or those with advanced liver disease (excluding decompensated cirrhosis) who have experienced several unsuccessful courses of treatment. Individual cases of successful retreatment of such patients with the combination of sofosbuvir, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have been observed. In a phase II trial, patients who failed to achieve SVR after a 12-week course of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were retreated with the triple combination of sofosbuvir plus glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 or 16 weeks. Only 1 out of the 23 patients, who received 12 weeks of therapy, failed to achieve SVR.  In particularly difficult-to-cure patients previously exposed to NS5A inhibitors, the triple combinations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, and of sofosbuvir plus glecaprevir and pibrentasvir may theoretically benefit from the addition of weight-based ribavirin and/or extension of treatment duration to 16 to 24 weeks. However, there are no data to support these indications, which must be decided on an individual basis by expert multidisciplinary teams, taking into consideration the many parameters at retreatment baseline, including severity of liver disease and/or extrahepatic manifestations, previous unsuccessful courses of treatment, RAS profiles, etc. The presence of decompensated cirrhosis will negate the use of protease inhibitor-based regimens, emphasising the need to institute retreatment as soon as possible."}]}

By convention, acute hepatitis C was defined as the first 6 months of infection, followed by chronic infection in the absence of spontaneous clearance. These definitions are challenged by recent insights into the natural history of HCV persistence, emerging trends in transmission patterns and the evolution of HCV therapy. \nAcute hepatitis C is generally benign and often asymptomatic.  In most cases, the diagnosis of HCV infection is based on elevated serum ALT levels, testing of high-risk populations or routine HCV screening.  Precise timing of infection is therefore difficult to establish. Several funding authorities have denied treatment reimbursement in patients considered to have acute hepatitis C, because the licensing of HCV DAAs was based on studies performed in patients with chronic infection. Given the high efficacy and safety of current HCV DAAs, such classification is a barrier to HCV elimination. In this context, the term \u201crecently acquired\u201d hepatitis C is more appropriate than acute hepatitis C. Recently acquired de novo HCV infection is defined by the presence of anti-HCV antibodies, HCV RNA and/or HCV core antigen that were not detectable in previous samples up to 12 months. If such historical samples are unavailable, the diagnosis of recently acquired hepatitis C is based on the presence of HCV RNA or HCV core antigen, in the presence or absence of anti-HCV antibodies, associated with a 3-fold or greater rise in ALT levels above baseline in an individual who had a risk behaviour in the preceding 6 months and in the absence of other causes of acute liver injury. Recently acquired HCV reinfection uses the same criteria following spontaneous or DAA-induced viral clearance. In this case, demonstration of a different strain by means of genome sequence analysis confirms reinfection. Recent data indicate that DAA treatment in the early phase of HCV infection is cost-effective and useful to achieve micro- elimination in specific groups of patients, whereas postponing therapy to meet the criteria for chronic infection increases the risk of HCV transmission. In HIV-infected patients, the lack of a 2-log drop of HCV RNA level 4 weeks after the initial presentation predicts a low-likelihood (negative predictive value <1%) of spontaneous clearance.  Thus, at least in individuals living with HIV, early chronic HCV infection can be defined as an estimated duration of infection <12 months and a lack of a 2-log reduction of HCV RNA levels 4 weeks after initial presentation with recently acquired hepatitis C. High SVR rates have been reported in a small number of pa- tients with recently acquired hepatitis C receiving DAA-based regimens. The ideal duration of treatment remains unknown. Three trials were performed with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in patients infected with genotype 1. The SVR rates were: 93% (13/14) after 4 weeks of treatment in injection drug users, 77% (20/26) after 6 weeks of treatment in HIV- positive individuals, and 100% (20/20) after 6 weeks of treatment in HIV-negative, non-injection drug users. The combination of ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir administered for 8 weeks yielded a 97% (29/30; 1 non-virological failure) SVR rate in patients with recently acquired hepatitis C in the TARGET-3D study. Finally, 6 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir yielded a 90% SVR12 rate (27/30; 1 virological failure) in patients with recently acquired hepatitis C.  In a multicentre international, open-label trial, patients with recently acquired hepatitis C were randomised into 2 groups to receive either 6 or 12 weeks of the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Interim analysis results were presented from 127 of the planned 250 inclusions. The SVR12 rates were 79% (53/67; 6 relapses) in the 6-week arm and 95% (57/60; no virological failure) in the 12-week arm. The high relapse rate in the short-duration arm led to early termination of the trial. In an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, international pilot study, 30 adults with recently acquired HCV infection (mean age 43 years, 90% men who have sex with men, 77% HIV-coinfected) were treated with the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. They were infected with genotypes 1, 4 and 3 in 83%, 10% and 7% of cases, respectively. The SVR12 rate was 90% (27/30; 1 relapse). Because at least 8 weeks of therapy are required to maximize SVR rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C, patients with recently acquired hepatitis C should be treated with DAA combinations for 8 weeks, pending additional data on the ideal treatment duration in this group. There is currently no indication for antiviral therapy as post-exposure prophylaxis in the absence of documented HCV transmission."}]}

Patients with pre-existing cofactors for liver disease (notably, history of excessive alcohol drinking, obesity and/or type 2 diabetes) should be carefully and periodically subjected to a thorough clinical assessment, as needed. Patients with advanced fibrosis (METAVIR score F3) and patients with cirrhosis (F4) who achieve an SVR should remain under surveillance for HCC every 6 months by ultrasound, and for oesophageal varices by endoscopy if varices were present at pre-treatment endoscopy (though first variceal bleed is seldom observed after SVR unless additional causes for ongoing liver damage are present and persist). In patients without varices at baseline, annual monitoring of platelet counts and transient elastography assessment allows for individualised monitoring with endoscopy. If platelet counts remain above 150,000 and elastography values <20 kPa, there is no need to perform endoscopy. The presence of cofactors for liver disease, such as a history of alcohol drinking or a metabolic syndrome associated with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes, may make additional assessments necessary. Long-term post-SVR follow-up studies showed that the risk of developing HCC remains in patients with cirrhosis who eliminate HCV, although it is significantly reduced compared to untreated patients or patients who did not achieve an SVR. Thus, the duration of HCC surveillance in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who achieve an SVR is indefinite. Reported rates of reinfection following successful HCV treatment among patients at high risk, such as PWIDs or men who have sex with men with high-risk behaviour, are of the order of 1\u20138% per year.  The ease of pangenotypic DAA-based therapy may increase the likelihood of reinfection, as recently suggested. To maximize the benefit of therapy, the risks of reinfection should be emphasised to patients at risk, and behavioural modifications should be positively reinforced. Patients at-risk should be monitored for reinfection and treatment should be offered without stigma or delay to those patients who are reinfected."}]}
