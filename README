# HCV-GPT: AI-Powered Hepatitis C Specialist

## Overview

HCV-GPT is an advanced AI assistant specifically designed to provide expert-level guidance on Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis and management. This tool leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models and retrieval augmented generation to offer insights based on the latest gold-standard recommendations from the 2020 Guidelines published by the European Association of The Study of The Liver.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface for asking questions about HCV
- Responses based on the latest HCV guidelines
- User-friendly Streamlit web application
- Customized AI responses using OpenAI's GPT-4 model
- Integration with external Word documents for prompt engineering and guidelines

## Installation

To set up the HCV-GPT project, follow these steps:

1. Download the HCV-RAG folder containing all the necessary files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the HCV-RAG folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/HCV-RAG
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install streamlit openai python-docx
   ```

5. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the HCV-RAG folder
   - Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

To run the HCV-GPT application:

1. Ensure you're in the HCV-RAG folder and your virtual environment is activated (if used).

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

4. Use the chat interface to ask questions about Hepatitis C virus. The AI will respond based on the latest guidelines and prompt engineering instructions.

## Project Structure

The HCV-RAG folder should contain the following files:

- `app.py`: Main application file containing the Streamlit web app and OpenAI integration
- `file1.docx`: Word document containing prompt engineering instructions
- `file2.docx`: Word document containing current HCV guidelines

## Customization

To customize the application:

1. Modify the `file1.docx` to update prompt engineering instructions.
2. Update `file2.docx` with the latest HCV guidelines when available.
3. Adjust the `MODEL_NAME` variable in `app.py` to use a different OpenAI model if needed.

## Dependencies

- streamlit
- openai
